By just buying the camera, you already get things like custom-made activity zones, and TP-Link is fairly generous with its totally free cloud storage (2 days' worth of video history).</p>
<p>There's a couple of other cool features in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving things if it identifies an intruder; a handy intercom function that allows the device to serve as a smart doorbell (although it doesn't have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hello doorbell ); and, since Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant.</p>

<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly fee for a set quantity of time, normally one to five years. No-contract systems, which allow you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of committing to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more typical. These systems sometimes cost more in advance for the hardware than professional systems that offer a discount rate in exchange for that lengthy service contract.

<p>What to consider: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 each month, but you'll pay a bit more if you wish to include additional functions, like a security camera. While a common contract runs 42 months (one of the longer agreement terms on our list), that requirement is just for users who wish to rent their equipment.
