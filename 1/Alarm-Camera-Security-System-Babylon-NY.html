<p>Are privately owned, operated surveillance cameras to be treated the exact same way as public cameras? We also require to draw great lines about 'Who actually is viewing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Huge bro? The Corporates? Or bugging neighbour? Who draws the line in between public interest and harassment? At the moment, nobody! The camera might legally do what a peeping tom might not do. They could peer inside of windows with the complete protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing viewing outside a window it could be a crime, yet the exact same person could place a surveillance camera then remotely see a person within the privacy of their home.

Wireless security systems are more agile and integratable, but low signal strength and bad connection are still common problems. Hardwired systems require minimal upkeep, and except a basic power failure, are harder to interfere with. In spite of a basic enhancement in wireless technology, there appear to be less ways for hardwired systems to be disrupted and paralyzed. </p>
