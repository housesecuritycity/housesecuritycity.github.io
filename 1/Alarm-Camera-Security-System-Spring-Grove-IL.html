<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not especially cutting-edge, so we're truly recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free plan alternative. Sure, you get a lower cost if you go with a three-year contract, however given that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a huge dedication. So select what will be the better deal for you. Go with the contract and gain those cost savings if you know you'll stay put for at least 3 years.
