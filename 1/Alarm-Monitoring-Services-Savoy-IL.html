<p>Nevermind how great the cameras are. The first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to 3rd party companies? I have actually dropped my Nest Cams because they were purchased by Google. Something we all need to consider. Sirens. So your camera has detected intruders or wild animals. Do you want to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Note that these sirens may violate local sound control laws, so examine ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
<p>What to consider: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 monthly, but you'll pay a bit more if you want to include extra features, like a security camera.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, however not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for more electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls however will still need cables to power the security camera independently, generally through 110VAC power. </p>
