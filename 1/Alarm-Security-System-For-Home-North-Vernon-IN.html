<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between people and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
