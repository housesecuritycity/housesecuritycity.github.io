<p>Several other designs were disqualified due to performance issues. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also plagued with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

However, this is typically a paid service and the number of hours it will store will depend on how much cloud storage you are willing to pay for.</p>

Provided all of the other benefits, it's easy to see why numerous individuals are picking this choice. </p>
