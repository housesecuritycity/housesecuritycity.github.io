<p>Do burglar alarms represent burglary decreases in the United States? The U.S. break-in rate has decreased gradually and significantly since the early 1980s. 13 Throughout the same time, the number of premises with alarms rose, however there is no proof of a link between the 2. During the 1990s through 2004, when alarm ownership experienced a high rise, other types of crime declined simply as greatly as robbery, suggesting that factors besides an increase in the variety of alarm sustained the break-in decrease.</p>
<p>So what takes place if something triggers your alarm but you're in a conference with a supplier and you do not get the alert? Or what if you've lastly gone on a much-needed holiday and your spotty cell service means you do not get signaled until the next day?
