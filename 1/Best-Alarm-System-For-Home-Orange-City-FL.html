<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
