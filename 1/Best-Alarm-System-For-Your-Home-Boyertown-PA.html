<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on 2 AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of totally free cloud storage, and it catches a better image and longer clips than its predecessors.

Also, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, don't expect to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened space.
