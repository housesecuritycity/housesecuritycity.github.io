<p>The Canary Flex features a smart version that sends out signals directly to your phone if you're looking for motion detection. This camera offers a wide range of features consisting of a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I reviewed a Swann camera I described it as decidedly middle of the road.

<p>What actually sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be pricey but is vital. In truth, we do not suggest buying this camera at all unless you plan to add the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection function, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity. Being able to distinguish between a car and a person, for example, allows you to reduce unnecessary alerts. And Activity Zones are a great perk, especially if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, an entrance, or even garbage cans. </p>
