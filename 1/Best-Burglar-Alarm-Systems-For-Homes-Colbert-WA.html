<p>While you need to pay for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it is among the more budget-friendly memberships out there at $2.99 a month. This is a costly security camera, but we think it's worth the financial investment.

Many websites needing alarm setups no longer have conventional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with traditional telephone dialer capability do not work dependably over some kinds of VoIP service.</p>
