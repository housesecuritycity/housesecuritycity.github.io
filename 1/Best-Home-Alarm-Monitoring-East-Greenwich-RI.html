<p>Nevermind how great the cameras are. The first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to 3rd party companies? I've dumped my Nest Cams since they were bought by Google. Something all of us need to think about. Sirens. So your camera has discovered burglars or wild animals. Do you want to terrify them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will suffice. Keep in mind that these sirens might breach local sound control laws, so examine ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
