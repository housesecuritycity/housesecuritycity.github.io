<p>The cover of darkness isn't enough to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does become a little an issue is in between identifying and recording motion. It takes a second for the camera to actually turn on when it detects motion because the Pro 2 doesn't do continuous video recording. They could get past the camera prior to it had time to record them if a nefarious criminal was fast enough.</p>
<p>Furthermore, acknowledge that your whole system might not be created to operate throughout a power blackout.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular because the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers recognize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
<p>Dome IP camera, as the name recommends, is a kind of CCTV camera with a dome cover. However beyond that I just had issues. The switch from daytime to night vision took about 5 minutes (though it worked great switching from night to day.) The motion detector is bad. I was carrying out the macarena in front of the camera for about 2 minutes prior to it even saw I existed. </p>
