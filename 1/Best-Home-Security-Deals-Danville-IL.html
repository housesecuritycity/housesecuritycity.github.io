<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are nearly similar to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are a little more expensive for the exact same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation costs are onerous, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyway.</p>
