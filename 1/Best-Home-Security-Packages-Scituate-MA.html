<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine people the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send smart device alerts with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
