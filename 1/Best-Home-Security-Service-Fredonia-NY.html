<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular because the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers realize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
