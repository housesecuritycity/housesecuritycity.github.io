<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously impressive piece of innovation. For starters, it looks gorgeous: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if strangely similar to the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey). It's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you might call to mind when you think of a home security camera. The very first wireless function to think about is the security system and its components, and how they all connect. In the past, every monitoring component was hard-wired back to a panel box. This indicated every windows and door needed its own wire and path of holes through your house.</p>
<p>Something that should be considered when setting up CCTV cameras is how they will be powered, and how wiring will be run throughout the building. In most cases, you'll be able to install cameras and wiring merely by running the wires through a drop tile ceiling and into the wall. Other jobs will demand using conduit - piping for running the circuitry and safeguarding it - and in some cases, removing part of the wall to lay electrical wiring inside. For these bigger jobs, expert security installation is generally the right option.</p>

With a wireless system, you can also get push notices on your phone or tablet that let you know there is an issue, even when you're not at home.</p>
