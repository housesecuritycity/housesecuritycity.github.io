<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, fraud, and theft. You get 1080p HD streaming, a 130-degree field of view, the typical motion notifies, and a 90+ dB alarm that is most likely to frighten any approaching burglar before they have actually got too far into your home.

<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered a data breach, but we agree with its suggestion that users need to reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a precautionary measure. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such incidents. Nevertheless, after this most current entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have chosen to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we don't think that these issues change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our existing suggestion.</p>

They can opt for wired or wireless systems without much trouble.</p>
