<p>If you do encounter a home intrusion emergency, you can set off the 80dB alarm. I am somewhat dissatisfied by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas lots of other alarm are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. Despite that, the alarm must suffice to frighten intruders most of the times. To recover expenses and hold alarm companies liable for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company must be certified, pay any registration or incorrect alarm fees, and supply physical evidence like camera video footage or a damaged window to warrant authorities reaction.</p>

<p>What actually sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be expensive but is necessary. In truth, we do not suggest purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to include the subscription. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity. Having the ability to compare a person and a car, for example, allows you to reduce unneeded alerts. And Activity Zones are a good perk, especially if you're aiming to monitor a specific corner of the yard, an entrance, and even garbage cans. </p>
