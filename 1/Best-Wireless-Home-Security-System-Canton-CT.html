<p>One vital exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 per month, which might be an affordable choice for customers in backwoods. We recommend cellular systems due to the fact that they're a lot more secure than landline systems, however there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't offered. If you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still much better than no security at all.</p>
<p>You can view the camera's feed live from the app at any time, and it supports multiple cameras, so wiring up the whole home for under â‚¤ 100 is totally possible. Footage can be saved to an optional microSD card in each camera, but is also kept for 14 days in the cloud free of charge, which is a terrific touch.
