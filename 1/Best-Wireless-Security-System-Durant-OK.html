Again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year dedication. I called their customer care team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the swelling sum, since obviously they vehicle renew you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a written not by mail.  ADT is a headache, way too expensive, and not terrific.</p>
