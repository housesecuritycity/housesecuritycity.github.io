<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to get out of the contract you need to pay 75% of the contract.  So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no idea I was in, to go out I have to pay $783.  Truly irritating. Again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year dedication. I called their customer care team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the swelling sum, since obviously they vehicle renew you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a written not by mail.  ADT is a headache, way too expensive, and not terrific.</p>
