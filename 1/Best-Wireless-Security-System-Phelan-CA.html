<p>Nothing is more vital than protecting what you treasure most ... your family and home. The implicit reason for the current push to increase video surveillance is the threat of terrorist attacks. However suicide attackers are clearly not hindered by camera - and might even be attracted to the television protection cameras can guarantee - and the expenditure of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far goes beyond the minimal advantages that the system may offer in examining attacks or attempted attacks after the truth (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>A system that needs a contract may be a wise choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems usually do not come with upfront charges. Rather, the expenses are expanded over the length of the agreement. We've seen 1-year, all the way approximately 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term arrangement (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>
