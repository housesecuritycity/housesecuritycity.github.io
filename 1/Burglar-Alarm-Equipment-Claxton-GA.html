<p>Lots of new security companies are developed for Do It Yourself installation only. ADT stays old-fashioned by setting up each security system themselves. One advantage of professional setup is getting peace of mind that all access points are protected. Expert installation can also be especially valuable if your home is big, if you get worried by DIY projects, and for many other reasons.</p>
<p>Naturally, the obvious drawback to a wired security system is that the preliminary install can be pricey. If the system was not installed throughout the homebuilding process, setting one up might need drilling holes into walls, running new wires, patching drywall and getting to hard spots that are sealed off in basements or attics. Wired security systems are also vulnerable to power blackouts. Many will have a backup battery system that switches on in case of a failure, but long term interruptions will result in the system losing power. It's also important to consider for how long you plan to remain at the very same residence when choosing a wired system. They are not portable and can't move with you because these security systems are integrated into the home's electrical wiring.</p>
