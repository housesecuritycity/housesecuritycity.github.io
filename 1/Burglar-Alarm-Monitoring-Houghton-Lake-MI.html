When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
