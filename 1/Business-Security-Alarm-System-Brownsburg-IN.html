<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be pricey but is necessary.

Without it, you will not get the person-detection function, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera spotted activity. Having the ability to distinguish between a person and a vehicle, for instance, allows you to reduce unnecessary informs. And Activity Zones are a good perk, especially if you're looking to monitor a particular corner of the backyard, an entrance, or even garbage cans. </p>
