<p>Recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered a data breach, but we concur with its suggestion that users ought to reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a precautionary procedure. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such occurrences. Nevertheless, after this latest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have actually chosen to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it concerns video items, we do not think that these concerns change the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our current suggestion.</p>
