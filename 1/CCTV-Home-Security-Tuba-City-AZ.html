It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be set up both inside your home and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have a contract, and its equipment prices is incredibly sensible, so it's not an overall splurge.

<p>You can set off the 80dB alarm if you do encounter a home intrusion emergency situation. I am slightly disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas many other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm ought to suffice to frighten trespassers most of the times. To hold and recover costs alarm companies accountable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company must be accredited, pay any registration or incorrect alarm costs, and offer physical proof like camera footage or a broken window to call for cops response.</p>

<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search technology that is rapidly altering the security industry, and it is called Deep Knowing". What is Deep Learning and why is it so important?  For starters, Deep Knowing permits someone to discover what they are trying to find without needing to search through hours of useless video footage.  Think of a web page that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the components you are looking for in the taped video footage.  For example, if we require to see all video from today that has a patrol car in it, we simply type cops" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a police cruiser appears.
