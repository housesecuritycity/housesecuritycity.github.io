<p>The Canary Flex features a smart variation that sends alerts directly to your phone if you're looking for motion detection. This camera provides a variety of functions including a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I reviewed a Swann camera I described it as distinctly middle of the roadway.

<p>We tried each of the cameras in multiple areas around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service.

Although FrontPoint offers a variety of equipment and home automation items at a sensible cost, the one location where the company especially stands out is in DIY installation. </p>
