This camera provides a variety of functions including a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I reviewed a Swann camera I described it as distinctly middle of the roadway.

Although FrontPoint offers a variety of equipment and home automation items at a sensible cost, the one location where the company especially stands out is in DIY installation. </p>
