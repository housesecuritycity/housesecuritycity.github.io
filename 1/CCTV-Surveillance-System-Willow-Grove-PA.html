<p>So far so normal. Things begin to get really interesting with the Nest's facial recognition system. If the camera identifies a face it doesn't identify, it will send an alert and picture to your phone, allowing you to give that individual the once over. If it's someone getting up to no good, the camera will follow their motions and conserve the timestamp, so you can easily find it in the future.

<p>Another advantage to monitored systems is if you buy a monitored security plan, the very same company that monitors the system will install it for you.

Wireless cameras can't have everything-- view things inside by day, and keep an eye on what's going on outside after dark. It hardly ever works.</p>
