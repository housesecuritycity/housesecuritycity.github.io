If you add monitoring, charges will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 each month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 per month. If you commit to a three-year agreement, the cost of the Nest service drops to $19 each month. Ring's Protect Plus plan chooses $10 each month and doesn't require a contract.</p>
