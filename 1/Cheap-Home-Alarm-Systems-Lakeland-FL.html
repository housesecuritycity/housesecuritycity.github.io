<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to determine those people and will send out mobile phone signals with that info when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV).
