<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the specific same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the burglar alarm. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>
