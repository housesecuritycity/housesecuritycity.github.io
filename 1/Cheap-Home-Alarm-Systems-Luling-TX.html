<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the specific same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut.

If someone were to unlock that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the burglar alarm.
