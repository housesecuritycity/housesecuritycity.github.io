However I also appreciate minimalist systems that elements that perform more than one action, like Minut. Some components can make home automation offered to you. Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensor, window sensor, smart lock, etc.), I want to make sure that they all easily interact with your app that is always at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>
