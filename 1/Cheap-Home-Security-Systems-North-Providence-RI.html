<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. If recording video footage in the dark is a concern, make certain your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
