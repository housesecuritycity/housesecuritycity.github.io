<p>When activated, burglar alarms most commonly do 7 main tasks. The first task is the alert of a siren, this allows for everybody in your neighborhood including the homeowners or entrepreneur to know that an intruder has actually been discovered. The second task is flashing outdoor lights. Not all burglar alarms have flashing outdoor lights but the most common burglar alarms and some of the advanced ones do.
