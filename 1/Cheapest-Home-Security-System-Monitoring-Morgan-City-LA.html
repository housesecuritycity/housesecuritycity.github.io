<p>A system that needs an agreement might be a clever choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?

We have actually seen 1-year, all the method up to 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>
