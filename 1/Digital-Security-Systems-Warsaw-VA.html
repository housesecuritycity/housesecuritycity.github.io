<p>Vivint Outdoor Camera Pro: As security system cameras go, the Vivint Outdoor Camera Pro is one of the best-- and it will deal with the rest of your Vivint system. The small, black orb of a dome camera offers a much better field of view than its bullet equivalent. It's likewise more subtle, more long lasting kinds of security cameras on the market. If you're trying to find a less assertive security camera system, the modest dome has its benefits. All the security with none of the appearance of watchfulness.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>We also like that Ring still has decent wise home support. Some other cheap security systems, like SimpliSafe and Cove, don't work so well with clever home devices like locks and lights. Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can integrate your clever outlets with your total security system. Wireless keypads and keychains so you can control your alarm system from anywhere inside or near your business. </p>
