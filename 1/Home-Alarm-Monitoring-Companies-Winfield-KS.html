<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can handle such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

Screens can be connected to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be set up to communicate through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>From monitoring windows and doors, to making certain the pool gate is secure, to getting a message when your safe is accessed, and even safeguarding the medication in the bathroom cabinet - the sensors are small adequate to offer distinct protection not offered with hard-wired alarm systems. Cameras with motion detection can send you alerts when the camera observes motion within its field of view. These notices can inform you to suspicious activity so you can monitor the scenario.</p>
<p>The primary reasons to choose an expert monitoring service are the increased security of having a live individual examining if the alarm isn't shut down within a certain time period, and contacting the police to do a welfare and come check if there isn't an answer, or a distress code is offered.

<p>Costs for systems vary. Bigger systems that use full-house protection with expert monitoring are the most pricey choices. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most inexpensive option. Remember that cameras with two-way audio typically work like walkie talkies. You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's taking place on the other end. And while this is a quite basic function in indoor cameras, two-way audio is reasonably unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>
