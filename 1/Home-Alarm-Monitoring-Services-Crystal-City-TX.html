<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send out smartphone alerts with that information when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
