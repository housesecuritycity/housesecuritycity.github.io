<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
<p>What actually sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be expensive but is essential. In fact, we do not recommend purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to add the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection function, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity. Having the ability to compare an automobile and a person, for instance, enables you to reduce unnecessary notifies. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, specifically if you're seeking to monitor a specific corner of the lawn, a doorway, or even trash bin. </p>
