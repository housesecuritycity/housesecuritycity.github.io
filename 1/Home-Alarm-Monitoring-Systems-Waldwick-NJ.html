<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
