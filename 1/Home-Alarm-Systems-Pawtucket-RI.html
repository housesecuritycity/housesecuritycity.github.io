<p>Now I explained this looked like a stretch considering previous Sims video games had burglars, but my pal pointed out the Sims 4 was produced a new generation, with a group of producers surrounded by people OF that generation who would mention that the invasion of their home or safe place could develop feelings of pain or possible even triggering. Indirectly I can see his point, I've been playing video games for a long period of time and a great deal of the things in earlier games I have actually played a decade earlier would definitely NEVER make the cut in todays politically charged gaming environment.</p>

<h3>House Alarm Systems Companies Pawtucket RI 02860</h3>

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to determine those people and will send out smartphone alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
