<p>There's no use in having an outdoor security camera if you can't recognize who or what the camera is looking at. A camera that catches video at 720p will usually use a fairly sharp picture, but 1080p video uses more information and is the most popular resolution for these devices; it does not need great deals of storage capacity and can be seen on nearly all phones, tablets, and PCs.</p>

The previous, less expensive variation of the outdoor Nest webcam is still on sale too if you wish to save some cash - it does have a cable television connected however, instead of working wirelessly, which indicates it's a bit easier to sabotage for prospective burglars.
