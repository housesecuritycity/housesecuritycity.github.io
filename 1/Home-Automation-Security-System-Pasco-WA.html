Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to discover any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires.

Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to neglect items that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.
