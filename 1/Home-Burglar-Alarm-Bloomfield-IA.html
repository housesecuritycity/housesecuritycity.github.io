<p>Arlo builds great home security cameras, and this third-generation Arlo Pro is a prime example of what this company can. While it doesn't have the eye-popping 4K resolution of the Arlo Ultra, it provides fantastic video quality and a lot of that more-expensive camera's other signature features for less.
