<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously impressive piece of innovation. For starters, it looks stunning: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily similar to the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). When you imagine a home security camera, it's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you might call to mind.

<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are almost similar to those of the Brinks system.
