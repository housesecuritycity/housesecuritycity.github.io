Methods consisted of searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV evaluation research study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV evaluations, and calling leading scientists to inquire about forthcoming examinations. Both released and unpublished reports were consisted of in the search, which was not limited to the English language and was worldwide in scope.</p>
