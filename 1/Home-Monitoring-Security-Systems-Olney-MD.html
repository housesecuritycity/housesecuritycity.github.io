<h3>Residential Security Alarm Systems in Olney MD</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
