<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>

Night vision is included too, for when the lights go out. </p>
