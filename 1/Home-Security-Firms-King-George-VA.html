In this case the alarm company owns the main equipment such as control board, keypad, motion sensor.

You can extend the amount of days you get by acquiring a membership, however I don't believe most people will need that option.</p>
<p>If I liked the appearance of the Nest, then I love the Hive View's style - definitely the most aesthetically pleasing camera on this list.
