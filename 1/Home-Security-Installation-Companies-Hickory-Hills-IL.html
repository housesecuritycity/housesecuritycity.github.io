Or ... no monitoring costs at all if you select the totally free self-monitor" choice.</p>

Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved.
