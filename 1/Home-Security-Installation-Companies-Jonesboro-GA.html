We likewise experienced above-average connection concerns, with two Hive test units detaching 8 times over 2 months.</p>
<p>Take some time to check out online reviews and not simply those on the company's website. Take a look at the Better Business Bureau site particularly.

<p>Dome IP camera, as the name recommends, is a type of CCTV camera with a dome cover. But beyond that I just had problems. The switch from daylight to night vision took about five minutes (though it worked great switching from night to day.) The motion detector is bad.
