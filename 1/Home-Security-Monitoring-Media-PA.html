<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the responsibility of the whole community. The equipment required for the wired system tends to be a bit less expensive than the wireless systems.

Pressure mats located underneath carpets at doorways can detect when an intruder steps into the room.

It will tape clips when it sees motion (and a few seconds prior to so you get the complete view of what occurred) and you can view these for a week before they're erased.
