<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never ever matches the producer's statistics since this comes from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant perpetrator for short battery life by far. We concur with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, however its recording capability is a bit limited to recommend as a top choice.</p>
