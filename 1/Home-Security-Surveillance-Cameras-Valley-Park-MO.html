<p>Primarily, it's hard to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, however it's better than a great deal of cameras that are 4 times the cost. The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after nearly two years of night, usage and day images have constantly been clear, and we never ever had problems with the camera missing out on motion, an issue we came across when evaluating the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a smart feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion found.
