The implicit justification for the current push to increase video surveillance is the threat of terrorist attacks. However suicide enemies are clearly not hindered by camera - and may even be attracted to the television protection cameras can guarantee - and the cost of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up roughly 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget plan - far exceeds the restricted advantages that the system may offer in investigating attacks or tried attacks after the truth (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
