<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers understand that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
