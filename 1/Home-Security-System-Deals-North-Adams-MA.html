<p>CCTV cameras are positioned in locations where they are thought to be most effective, which generally consists of highly inhabited towns, town hall, parking area, or various other high-crime areas (Welsh and Farrington 2008). Given that the placement of these cameras is very important, the criminal offense patterns in areas of interest are usually studied for time periods to identify crime hotspots where cameras could potentially be put.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular since the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients realize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
