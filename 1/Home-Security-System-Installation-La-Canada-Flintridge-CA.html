<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional electrical wiring.
