That's why we check them for information security and data privacy. Surveillance is the act of monitoring something or somebody, mostly to find or avoid criminal offense. With this in mind, video surveillance is the act of observing something with the aid of electronic monitoring and video recording.

<p>Another important topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend how much is enough. In this article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video image; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The very same holds true of high-resolution Television Set, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much photo information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false complacency given that it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
