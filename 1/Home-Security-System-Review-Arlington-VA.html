On the easier side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of smart home equipment for flexibility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, but you can't include a lots of other smart home tech to the system. It will not deal with loads of smart home equipment from other companies.
