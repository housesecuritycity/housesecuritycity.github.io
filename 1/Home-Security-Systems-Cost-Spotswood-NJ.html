<h3>Monitored Home Alarm in Spotswood NJ</h3>
<p>If you sign a 36-month monitoring contract, Frontpoint offers a $300 discount on equipment. When you speak to a representative, be sure to ask for this discount rate. Downside: some systems have a high rate of false alarms because a few of these sensors may be too delicate. Although systems utilizing DSP (digital signal processing) will largely eliminate incorrect alarms on some cases.</p>
<p>Another factor to think about is security, a wireless connection is somewhat easy for hackers to access. If a hacker were to get to your wireless network they would likewise have access to the security cameras and the data being captured.  There are gadgets called wifi jammers that trigger the signal to jam rendering the camera useless for recording that activity.</p>

<p>Some security cameras permit you to set up customized activity zones, meaning that you pick the areas that are most considerable for catching movement. One of the biggest advantages of this feature is it prevents you from being notified of insignificant activity, like a vehicle driving by or an insect flying by your camera. The Deep Guard is unlike every other home security camera. That's because when the camera spot an intruder, it sends a live feed to a monitoring station, where a professional can sound an alarm on the camera, yell a caution, and if needed, get in touch with the cops.</p>
