Without taking the correct security preventative measures, you could be leaving your home open up to trespassers who can jam your system and enter your home without your sensing units getting their presence.</p>
<p>Home automation is practical and simple, and wireless systems help you automate your home that much easier.

That isn't to say that you can't have actually wired home automation, since you can, but automatic equipment that is hardwired into your system is slower and more difficult to encrypt. It isn't very clever. Wireless gadgets interact more securely and faster to other devices on the system and to the monitoring center (if you pick monitoring).</p>
