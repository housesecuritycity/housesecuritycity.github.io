<p>However, convenience does not necessarily come with added security. Going from wired to wireless security implies potentially exposing yourself to outside attacks if you don't do it right. You don't need to go into a house to cut the wire with wireless," the way you would with wired security, warns Du. Without taking the correct security preventative measures, you could be leaving your home open up to trespassers who can jam your system and enter your home without your sensing units getting their presence.</p>
<p>Home automation is practical and simple, and wireless systems help you automate your home that much easier.

That isn't to say that you can't have actually wired home automation, since you can, but automatic equipment that is hardwired into your system is slower and more difficult to encrypt. It isn't very clever. Wireless gadgets interact more securely and faster to other devices on the system and to the monitoring center (if you pick monitoring).</p>
