<p>Somewhat more pricey than our winning wise alarm, this system was almost as easy to install and, throughout testing, the loud, clear siren was quick to sound if among the sensing units had been set off. We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and only alerts you when motion is created by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no false signals). However, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have extra sensing units and essential fobs, too.</p>

These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
