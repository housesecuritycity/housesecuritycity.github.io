Since the system is wired into your home, it doesn't need to count on a wi-fi network in order to relay details. Rather of utilizing wi-fi, a wired system works like a landline.</p>
<p>The most significant drawback of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensor gets activated while you're away, you have no visual ways of confirming if something is actually wrong and how major the situation is.
