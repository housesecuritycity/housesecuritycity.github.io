<p>While you need to spend for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it is among the more affordable subscriptions out there at $2.99 a month. This is a pricey security camera, but we think it deserves the financial investment. Increasing release of voice over IP technology (VoIP) is driving the adoption of broadband signaling for alarm reporting. Lots of websites requiring alarm installations no longer have standard telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with standard telephone dialer capability do not work dependably over some kinds of VoIP service.</p>
