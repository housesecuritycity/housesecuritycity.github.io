<p>A taut wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires.

This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
