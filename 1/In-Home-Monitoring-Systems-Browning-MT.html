<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send smartphone alerts with that details when they show up at your home.

We likewise discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
