Smart locks, programmable thermostats, cameras, and other automatic home gadgets are by their very nature wireless, and a lot of home security companies provide a home automation bundle with an app to from another location control whatever on the system. That isn't to say that you can't have actually wired home automation, due to the fact that you can, however automatic equipment that is hardwired into your system is slower and harder to secure.

If you ever desire more features, you can just add on private tools for a fairly low price. Ring Alarm is very budget-friendly and has good smart home support.
