<p>Extremely simply, the individual at the door presses the button. You'll get a notification to your phone (you can also get a Ring Chime WiFi extender if you want a doorbell sound too.) The camera then streams a video-link to your phone (or Amazon Echo Program, if you have among those) - and since it works as an intercom, you can then have a chat with the individual at the door if you so wish. Useful if, for instance, it's the postman and you're out. You can advise him or her where to leave the goods.</p>
