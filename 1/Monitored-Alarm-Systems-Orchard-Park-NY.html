<h3>Cheap Home Security Cameras in New York</h3>
<p>A wired security camera can can be found in 2 types, both requiring wires to provide power and for the purposes of video transmission. The camera's seeing angle identifies how much space the camera will cover. Wide-angle lenses decrease the variety of cameras required to monitor your home. Some outdoor security cameras have a wide-angle lens that may reveal a 360-degree view, however the best security cameras have a view of at least 100 degrees or better.</p>
<p>Throughout our testing, this compact camera taped sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom worked for taking a closer look.

For less than $400, you get two door and window sensing units, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>
