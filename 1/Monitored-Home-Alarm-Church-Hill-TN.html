<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
