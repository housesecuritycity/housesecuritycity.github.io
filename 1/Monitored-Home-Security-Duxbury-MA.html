The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without problem. The IR lights in the evening have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the cost and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
