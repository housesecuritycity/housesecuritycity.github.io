<p>A number of other models were disqualified due to efficiency issues. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (up to 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of approximately 90 seconds between videos.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
