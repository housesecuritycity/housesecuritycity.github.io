We also discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
