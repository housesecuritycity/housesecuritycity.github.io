<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
