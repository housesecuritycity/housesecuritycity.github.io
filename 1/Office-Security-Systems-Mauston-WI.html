<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our testing-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video.

Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it pertains to surveillance cameras, there are some difficult repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
