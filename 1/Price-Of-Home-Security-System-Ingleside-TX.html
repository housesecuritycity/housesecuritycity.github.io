It can be slow and uncomfortable to use on event - with the procedure of linking to the camera for a live view rather sluggish sometimes. The previous, cheaper variation of the outdoor Nest camera is still on sale too if you wish to save some money - it does have actually a cable television attached though, rather than working wirelessly, which suggests it's a bit simpler to mess up for possible trespassers.

It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view.

It can compare basic motion and individuals, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even identify people you have actually identified (after a learning duration).
