The camera can tape video in approximately 1080p, which looks perfectly fine on a smartphone screen and will not tax your web connection excessive.

<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had actually suffered a data breach, but we agree with its suggestion that users must reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a preventive step. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such events.

If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide.
