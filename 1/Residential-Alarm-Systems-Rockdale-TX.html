<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
