<p>Studies reveal surveillance cameras minimize crime. Wired: Each camera is linked to a recording system, which in turn is linked to a router. Installation can be complex - especially if your home has actually currently been built - so be sure to consult with a professional before handling the task yourself. Wired home security cameras send information through a closed circuit, not over a signal. They're also not susceptible to interference such as cellular and radio frequencies. If you have a big home or property that requires comprehensive protection, wired systems are a much better option because they can support more cameras.</p>
<p>Your security system will be monitored by our operators at our own UL Listed main monitoring station.

You will not receive a money or charge card refund of your pre-payment.
