<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens.

Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
