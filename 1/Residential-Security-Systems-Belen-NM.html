The exact same holds true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about 4 times as much picture information as 1080p.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
<p>The downside? It's very simple to commit security mistakes that will leave your home vulnerable. The moment you eliminate of signal range or turn your phone to airplane mode is the moment you have actually left your house open. If you aren't careful, this gaping hole in your security can show to be a big issue. With a monitored system, that wouldn't be a problem. However, with an unmonitored system, it's up to you to call the cops or other emergency situation services if your home is in risk. Still, the unmonitored system is much less pricey and for that reason is still the better alternative for many who are just concerned about cost. </p>
