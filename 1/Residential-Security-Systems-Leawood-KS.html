<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine people the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment.

We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV).
