<p>We didn't think about alarm systems that required expert installation. Pro-installed systems usually cost more, use equipment comparable to that of DIY systems, come with normally onerous and long agreements, and frequently rely on the exact same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they use little advantage. A good example is the Vivint system, which we have actually evaluated independently and don't recommend for the majority of people.</p>

The system can be set up to communicate through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
