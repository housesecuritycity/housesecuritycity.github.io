<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine people the camera is finding utilizing face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send smartphone informs with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
