<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to overlook items that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
