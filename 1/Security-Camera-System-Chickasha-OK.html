<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular because the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
