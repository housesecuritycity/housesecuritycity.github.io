<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients understand that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
