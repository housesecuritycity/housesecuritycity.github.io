With other companies, like ADT, you pay a small amount upfront. The system is valued at more than $200 though, and more payment is developed into a monthly monitoring bill. Essentially you lease to own a wireless security system.</p>

It takes a 2nd for the camera to actually turn on when it discovers motion due to the fact that the Pro 2 does not do continuous video recording.

This camera uses a wide range of functions consisting of a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I evaluated a Swann camera I explained it as extremely middle of the road.
