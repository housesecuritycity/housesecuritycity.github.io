<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video in the dark is a priority.</p>

We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise offer a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
