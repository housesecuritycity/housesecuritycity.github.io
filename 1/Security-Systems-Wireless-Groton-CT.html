<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many alarm systems work the specific same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electric current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical present to stream throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will trigger.</p>
