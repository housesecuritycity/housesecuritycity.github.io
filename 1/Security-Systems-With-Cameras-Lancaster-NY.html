<p>Are privately owned, operated surveillance cameras to be treated the same method as public cameras? We also need to draw great lines about 'Who truly is watching you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Big brother? The Corporates? Or bothering neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the minute, no one! The camera could lawfully do what a peeping tom could refrain from doing. They might peer within windows with the complete protection of the law on their side. If an individual was standing enjoying outside a window it could be a criminal activity, yet the same person could position a surveillance camera then from another location see a person within the personal privacy of their home.

Not to point out that the customer support experience differs commonly depending on the dealer you go with. </p>
