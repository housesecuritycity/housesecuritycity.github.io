After a while, the camera will discover to identify those people and will send mobile phone signals with that information when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV).
