<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the exact very same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current.

Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door enables the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
