<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large quantity of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually by means of 110VAC power. </p>
