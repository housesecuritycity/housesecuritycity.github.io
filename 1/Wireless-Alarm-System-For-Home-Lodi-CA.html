As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal given that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
