<p>Studies reveal surveillance cameras lower crime. The overall cost of a home security system can be measured in three phases: purchase cost, installation expenses, and operating expenses gradually. Purchase cost varies by provider, equipment plan, and payment options.

Find out more about customer financing here.</p>
<p>Right now you can get 20% off your SimpliSafe equipment package when you pick the Interactive Monitoring plan at checkout. That's nearly $100 off the most costly bundle, The Sanctuary-- putting it at just under $400 total.

Alternately, if you don't have a home automation center, try to find a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth lock that comes with its own mobile app. Smart locks use basic pre-drilled holes and are relatively easy to install. Some designs utilize your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and connect to the within your door, while others need that you remove your existing interior and exterior escutcheons and change the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>

<p>Carbon monoxide detection. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that can be harmful to both human beings and animals. Since carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless, the only way to monitor hazardous levels of this gas is with a carbon monoxide detector. Fortunately, most wireless security systems include carbon monoxide alarms that sound off if the amount of CO in your home rises to a dangerous level.
