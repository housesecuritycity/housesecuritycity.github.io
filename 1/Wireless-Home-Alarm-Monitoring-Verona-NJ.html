<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company. When the system detects a break-in, fire, or other emergency, it alerts the security group and, in some cases, emergency situation responders. Unfortunately, history has actually shown that surveillance technologies put in location for one function undoubtedly broaden into other usages. And with video innovation likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear limits for what CCTV systems should be able to do postures a considerable threat.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those individuals and will send smartphone notifies with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
