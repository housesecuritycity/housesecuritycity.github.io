<p>We also look at the features that are offered through the camera's app. Does it have such things as personalized motion zones? You don't want the camera recording video and informing you every time a vehicle drives by if you live on a busy street.

When buying a video recorder, you need to initially make certain that the device will deal with the cameras you've acquired.
