Commercial-grade cameras are designed and constructed for high-performance applications where failure is not a choice; consumer-grade cameras are not. Usually, consumer-grade cameras are developed to work well when there is lots of readily available light, and when the lighting becomes low or missing (believe sunset or nighttime), their pedigree starts to reveal.
