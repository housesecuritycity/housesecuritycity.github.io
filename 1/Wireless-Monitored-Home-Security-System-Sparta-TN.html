<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal given that the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
