<p>Some wireless home security systems offer a video recording storage alternative and others do not. For the ones that don't, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is tape-recorded. The systems with video storage usually consist of either a local storage or cloud storage option. A local storage option conserves a pre-determined number of video clips on the gadget itself. This alternative is typically cost-free. A cloud storage alternative saves your video clips in the cloud.
