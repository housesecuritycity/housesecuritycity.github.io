<p>Alarm systems have actually ended up being basic equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're ending up being increasingly common in private homes also. When it comes to the EZVIZ Complete HD Indoor Smart Security Camera in our best security camera round-up, the pros far outweigh the cons: it has a strong 1080p video feed, night vision, a decent 135-degree field of view, two-way audio and a straightforward app. Aside from the name, ADT also has a vast array of security equipment to protect your home.
