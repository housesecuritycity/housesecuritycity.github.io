<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, the majority of alarm systems work the exact same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
