<p>Are independently owned, ran surveillance cameras to be dealt with the exact same way as public cameras? We likewise need to draw fine lines about 'Who really is viewing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Big bro? The Corporates? Or harassing neighbour? Who draws the line in between public interest and harassment? At the moment, nobody! The camera might legally do what a peeping tom could refrain from doing. They might peer within windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If an individual was standing seeing outside a window it might be a criminal activity, yet the exact same individual might place a surveillance camera then from another location view a person within the personal privacy of their home.

Being able to compare a cars and truck and an individual, for instance, allows you to minimize unneeded alerts.
