Only those cameras that are developed to endure the components ought to be placed on the outside of your house.</p>

It just does not build up. To use such low prices, manufacturers must cut corners, and the end outcome is compromised efficiency. What good is a surveillance camera that only works preferably in best conditions like bright sunlight?
