<p>Unmonitored alarm systems: These alarms develop a loud noise that is inside both audible and outside the home.

<p>There's a few other cool features in the camera itself such as an automatic zoom which tracks moving things if it discovers an intruder; a helpful intercom function that permits the gadget to function as a wise doorbell (although it doesn't have a chime or button - for that you'll require the Nest Hey there doorbell ); and, given that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant.</p>
