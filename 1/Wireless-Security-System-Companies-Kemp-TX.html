<p>For all the advantages of Nest Secure, the quality of customer service is not one of them. In reality, unhappy consumers generally have an issue getting across knowledgeable service technicians when they have technical concerns. This is a well-designed camera and center combination, which consists of a lasting battery, and which is readily available at a decent price. It's definitely worth a place on our list of the best security cameras 2020, even if there are some issues (the picture quality isn't the strongest we've evaluated, for example).</p>
<p>What truly sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be pricey but is important.

Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera identified activity. Being able to compare an individual and a cars and truck, for instance, allows you to reduce unneeded signals.
