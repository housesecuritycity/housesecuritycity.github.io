Many insurance companies offer discounts on insurance coverage premiums to clients with operable alarm systems. These discounts may be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous cops departments provide a number of "complimentary" incorrect alarms prior to enforcing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to react is substantial right from the start.
