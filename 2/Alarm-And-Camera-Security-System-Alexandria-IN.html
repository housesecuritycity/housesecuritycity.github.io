When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the burglar alarm.

Despite a general enhancement in wireless technology, there seem fewer ways for hardwired systems to be disrupted and incapacitated. </p>
