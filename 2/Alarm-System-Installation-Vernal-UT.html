<p>Multiple monitors were set up within the new command center with a single monitor assigned to alarm screens. When any alarm system incorporated into the PCU was activated, the closest camera to that area would be shown on that specific monitor. The opportunity that the repaired camera would be pointed in the direction of the incident depends on the initial requirements for location of coverage. If there are 3 select fire escape, panic alarms, or door sensing units, a single fixed camera can only see one. This develops a one in three opportunity of capturing a specific occurrence on video (either live or tape-recorded). The command center also included a computer system designated for submitting event reports online. These can be accessed by management workers at a later date from a database through the computer network.</p>
