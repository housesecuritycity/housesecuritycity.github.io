And while this is a quite basic feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is relatively uncommon in outdoor security cameras.</p>

<p>The primary intent of the law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies and their clients more accountable for false alarms, and reduce the variety of unnecessary authorities and fire reactions.
