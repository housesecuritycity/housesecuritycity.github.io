<h3>Commercial Security Systems in Winona MN</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk to an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimum performance.

A wireless bridge is a terrific alternative for long range circumstances where trees and poles are not present.</p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never matches the maker's statistics since this originates from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest offender for short battery life without a doubt.
