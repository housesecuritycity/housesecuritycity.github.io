<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely regular considering that the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
