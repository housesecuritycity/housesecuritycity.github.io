<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular because the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers recognize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
