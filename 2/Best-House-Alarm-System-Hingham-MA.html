I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send alerts, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

It is also equipped with a 3x digital zoom function that allows you to zoom in and catch details such as facial features in case of burglaries.</p>
