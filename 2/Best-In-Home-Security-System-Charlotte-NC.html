<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send smartphone signals with that information when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
