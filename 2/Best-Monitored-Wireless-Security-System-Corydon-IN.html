<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
