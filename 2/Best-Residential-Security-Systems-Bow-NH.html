<p>While every house owner frets about burglaries, apprehension has surrounded home security systems due to their typically high costs, complicated agreements with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces frequently leading to incorrect alarms.

<p>A system that needs a contract might be a clever option for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?

We have actually seen 1-year, all the method up to 5-year contracts!

Both published and unpublished reports were consisted of in the search, which was not restricted to the English language and was worldwide in scope.</p>
