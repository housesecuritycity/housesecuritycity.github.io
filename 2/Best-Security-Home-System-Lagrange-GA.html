Placed on shelves, tables, and countertops, they allow you to keep an eye on what your family pets are doing, know when the kids get back from school, or find who's been hitting the liquor cabinet. Many even permit you to communicate with whoever is on-camera as the action is occurring, by means of an embedded microphone and speaker.</p>
<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 monthly, but you'll pay a little bit more if you wish to include additional functions, like a security camera.
