<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically more secure, but after reading this short article, it will sure make you feel virtually vulnerable. The other notable features of the Pro 2 are that unlike the Q Plus (the other Arlo design which I'm going to discuss in just a 2nd), it is created for outdoor in addition to indoor usage, so it'll work come rain or shine.
