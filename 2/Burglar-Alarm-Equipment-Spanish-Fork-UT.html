<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize individuals the camera is finding using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send mobile phone signals with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
