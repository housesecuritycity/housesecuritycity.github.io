<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to overlook objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>

Improper home network configurations, flaws in the devices or password compromise might enable a hacker to burglarize the system and identify if anyone is home, or even seize control.

After a time, video can be compressed to save storage area, for example.</p>
