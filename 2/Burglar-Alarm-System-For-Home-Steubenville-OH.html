<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical given that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>

Our tester said the technician provided solid client service: He dropped a few unneeded window sensors from my expense after deciding that the motion detector sufficed for the entire front half of my home."
