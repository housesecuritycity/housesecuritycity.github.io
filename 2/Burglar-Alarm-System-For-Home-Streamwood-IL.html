<p>I have this camera connected to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk intending into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without problem. The IR lights at night have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle.

<h3>Security System House Streamwood IL 60107</h3>
<p>SimpliSafe equipment covers the basics. But while ADT systems deal with Z-Wave devices, SimpliSafe systems don't. This seriously limits your options for syncing a SimpliSafe system with third-party smart home gadgets like lights, thermostats, outlets, and locks.
