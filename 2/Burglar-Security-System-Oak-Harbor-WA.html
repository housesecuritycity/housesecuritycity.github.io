<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
<p>Lastly, I take a look at a home security system's app, making sure it's user-friendly and highly sound, particularly if there is home automation involved.
