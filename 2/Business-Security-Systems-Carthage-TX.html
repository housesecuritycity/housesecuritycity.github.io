<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a harmful assailant, because the disruption of the network avoids the flow of data and really indirectly protects data by avoiding it from being transmitted. The normal factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, supplying a chance for the harmful opponent to tape-record these codes and use various cracking tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools offered which can release a dictionary style attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based upon the "model" security key captured during the network recovery.</p>
