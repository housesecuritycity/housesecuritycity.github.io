<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are almost similar to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are slightly more expensive for the same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation fees are burdensome, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyway.</p>
<p>Wish to add a flood sensor? A smart door lock? Your system can serve as a center for as much as 119 wise home devices, and can be managed by means of Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple TV, and more. Wireless systems can be set up within minutes. You don't even need to be tech-savvy to do it.

<p>So what happens if something triggers your alarm but you remain in a conference with a vendor and you do not get the alert? Or what if you've lastly gone on a much-needed vacation and your spotty cell service means you do not get informed until the next day? If your system equipment consists of an audible alarm, the noise may scare off potential trespassers-- if you're lucky. However the authorities will not come until you personally call them. </p>
