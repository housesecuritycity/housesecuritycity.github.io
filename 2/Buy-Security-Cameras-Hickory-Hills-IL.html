<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize people the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send out smart device alerts with that information when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
