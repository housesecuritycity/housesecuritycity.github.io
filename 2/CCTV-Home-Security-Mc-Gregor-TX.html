<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal because the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
