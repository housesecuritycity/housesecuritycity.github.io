<p>Vivint Outdoor Camera Pro: As security system cameras go, the Vivint Outdoor Camera Pro is among the best-- and it will deal with the rest of your Vivint system. The small, black orb of a dome camera uses a better field of view than its bullet equivalent. It's also more subtle, more long lasting kinds of security cameras on the marketplace. The humble dome has its advantages if you're looking for a less assertive security camera system. All the security with none of the look of vigilance.</p>
<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 monthly, however you'll pay a little more if you want to include extra features, like a security camera. While a common contract runs 42 months (among the longer agreement terms on our list), that requirement is only for users who want to rent their equipment. Vivint has no minimum agreement requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>
<p>What actually sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be expensive but is necessary. In fact, we do not suggest buying this camera at all unless you prepare to include the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera spotted activity. Being able to distinguish between a vehicle and a person, for instance, allows you to minimize unneeded alerts. And Activity Zones are a great perk, specifically if you're aiming to monitor a particular corner of the backyard, an entrance, or even garbage cans. </p>
