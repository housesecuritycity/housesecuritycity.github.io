After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>

Although FrontPoint offers a variety of equipment and home automation products at an affordable cost, the one location where the company especially stands out is in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
