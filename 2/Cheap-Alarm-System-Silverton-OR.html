<p>Typically a wired system can be confused with local alarms. However, the 2 are considerably different. The main difference is that the wired system couple with the other smart home devices to produce a network of home security around your home. It can be managed remotely through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile device or through the control panel (also called the alarm panel). A local system does not have the capability to couple with other wise gadgets and can not be managed remotely. Likewise a local alarm will not call the authorities; it simply sets off an audible siren to inform people nearby.</p>

All of the cameras were linked to the exact same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router indoors (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
