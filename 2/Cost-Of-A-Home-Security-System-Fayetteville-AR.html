<p>A taut wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to find any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to ignore things that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
