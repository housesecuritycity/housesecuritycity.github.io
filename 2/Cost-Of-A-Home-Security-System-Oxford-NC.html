<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and might even activate incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the police if they occur frequently enough. Another prospective disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically balanced out by the truth that there are no installation costs.</p>
