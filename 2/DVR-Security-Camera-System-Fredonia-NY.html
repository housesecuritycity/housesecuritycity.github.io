<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in numerous places around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) in addition to an Android smart device (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint offers a wide range of equipment and home automation products at a reasonable rate, the one location where the company particularly excels remains in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
