<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false sense of security because it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
