<p>Just recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered an information breach, but we agree with its recommendation that users should reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a precautionary procedure. All smart-home gadgets are vulnerable to such occurrences. However, after this latest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we do not think that these concerns modify the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our current recommendation.</p>

The previous, less expensive variation of the outdoor Nest webcam is still on sale too if you wish to save some money - it does have actually a cable attached though, rather than working wirelessly, which indicates it's a bit easier to undermine for possible trespassers. Definitely one of the very best security cameras in 2020.</p>
