<p>Signed up for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later. The company that installed my alarm went out of business so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company.

<h3>House Security Alarm System in Snellville GA</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>

When buying a video recorder, you need to initially make certain that the device will deal with the cameras you've acquired.
