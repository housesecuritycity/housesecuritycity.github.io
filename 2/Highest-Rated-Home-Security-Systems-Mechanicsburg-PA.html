<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
<p>Security cameras do raise important privacy concerns, due to the fact that they can allow you to spy on household, friends, and anybody else who crosses the limit of your home, possibly without their consent. (For a much deeper take a look at potential personal privacy and legal concerns, see our post Security Cameras, Ethics, and the Law") Buying a Wi-Fi camera must be a household choice in which placement, usage, and viewing is concurred upon by everybody concerned, but that may also consist of babysitters, housekeepers, and tradespeople, depending on local laws. This means that deciding which camera is best for you might depend on how obvious you want it to be and what it will tape-record. </p>
