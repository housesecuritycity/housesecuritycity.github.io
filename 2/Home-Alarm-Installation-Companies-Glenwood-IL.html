<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical given that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers understand that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

It costs a lot, its prices isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to discuss that the customer support experience differs widely depending upon the dealer you opt for. </p>
