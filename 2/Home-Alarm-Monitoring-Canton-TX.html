<p>You can set off the 80dB alarm if you do come across a home intrusion emergency. I am a little disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas numerous other alarm are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm should be enough to frighten burglars in most cases. To recoup expenses and hold alarm companies liable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company should be licensed, pay any registration or false alarm charges, and provide physical proof like camera video or a broken window to call for cops reaction.</p>

<p>A taut wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall.

Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge.
