<p>Different kinds of CCTV cameras. All of the cameras were easy to install. Each camera has an app that strolls you through the setup procedure. This typically involves finding an area for your camera, creating an account in the app, and connecting the camera to your Wi-Fi network. Much of them then permit you to configure the alert frequency and produce activity monitoring zones, so the camera will capture motion only in designated locations-- a function we find necessary for high-traffic areas, which could set off a great deal of incorrect signals.</p>
