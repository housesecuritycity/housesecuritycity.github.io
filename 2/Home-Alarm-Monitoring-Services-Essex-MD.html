<p>Seattle's main intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more responsible for false alarms, and lower the variety of unnecessary police and fire responses. Alarm monitoring companies are the professionals and need to be teaching their clients how to correctly care and set for their alarm. National and local data have shown that raising fines paid straight by services and property owners have actually had no considerable impact on lowering the number of false alarms. Alarm-monitoring companies have enjoyed the benefit of cops response to their clients' alarms with no responsibility for the precision or dependability of those alarms.</p>

Wireless cameras can't have all of it-- watch things inside by day, and watch on what's going on outside after dark. It rarely works.</p>
