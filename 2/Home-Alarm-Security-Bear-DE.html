Nevertheless, after this most current entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video items, we don't believe that these problems modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our current suggestion.</p>
