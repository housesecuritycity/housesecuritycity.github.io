<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you desire to get out of the contract you have to pay 75% of the agreement.. So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no idea I remained in, to go out I have to pay $783.  Actually frustrating. Again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not point out the 3 year dedication. I called their client service team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the lump sum, due to the fact that obviously they vehicle renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a composed not by mail.
