False alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they happen frequently enough. Another possible drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working.
