<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, however not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for more circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually by means of 110VAC power. </p>
