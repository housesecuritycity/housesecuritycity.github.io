We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare people and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
