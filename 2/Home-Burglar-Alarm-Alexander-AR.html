Yet, lots of lingering questions stay and will continue to drive argument for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>A lot of video records images in the natural light or infrared spectrums. Thermal cameras can also catch video of an individual's motions based on body temperature level.

The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly progressed into the highly advanced yet cost effective systems available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape video and view it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>
