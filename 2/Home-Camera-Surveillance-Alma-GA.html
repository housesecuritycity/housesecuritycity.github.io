<p>For these separate systems to converge or to incorporate them together into a single user interface, a comprehensive understanding of all the required systems is necessary. There are only two options if there are no as-built files supplying functionality and setup information to make this integration work. The very first option, which may be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original solution provider is not available or unwilling to provide those details) and record the topology and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other approach is to replace and rip, carrying out a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>

<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and frequently over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for further circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less electrical wiring in the walls however will still require cable televisions to power the security camera separately, normally via 110VAC power. </p>
