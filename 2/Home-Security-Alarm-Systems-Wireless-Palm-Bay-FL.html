<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically safer, however after reading this post, it will sure make you feel essentially vulnerable. A couple of minutes into the Do It Yourself installation, our tester got stuck getting her control panel up and online-- it simply wouldn't connect. A help window appeared with a number to call, and a Frontpoint associate helped her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he could tell there was a concern with the circuit board.
