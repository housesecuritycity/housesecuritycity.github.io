<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search technology that is quickly altering the security market, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Learning and why is it so important?  For starters, Deep Learning allows somebody to find what they are looking for without needing to search through hours of ineffective video footage.  Think of a web page that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the elements you are trying to find in the tape-recorded video footage.  For instance, if we require to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we just type police" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a police car appears.  With deep knowing video search, you now have an effective solution for collecting and capturing lawbreakers evidence.</p>

For the ones that do not, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is taped. The systems with video storage generally include either a local storage or cloud storage choice. A local storage choice conserves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the device itself. This option is generally cost-free. A cloud storage option saves your video in the cloud. However, this is generally a paid service and the number of hours it will keep will depend upon just how much cloud storage you want to pay for.</p>
