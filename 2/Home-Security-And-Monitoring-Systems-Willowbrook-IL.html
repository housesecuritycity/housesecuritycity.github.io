We initially saw Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it rapidly ended up being a personnel (and friends and family) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker.
