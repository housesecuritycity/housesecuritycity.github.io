<p>The Kasa Camera Outdoor KC200 provides strong security performance and simple installation at a budget friendly cost.

<h2>Video Security & Surveillance Solutions Eastman</h2>
<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable television and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can handle such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom. The DVR converts the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and after that stores it on a disk drive for later retrieval. Screens can be connected to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be established to interact by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>Physical security is paramount for your staff members, clients and daily operations.
