<p>Another crucial topic to go over is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand how much is enough. In this post, the term resolution" refers to the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video picture; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The very same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much photo info as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.

In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect sense of security given that it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
