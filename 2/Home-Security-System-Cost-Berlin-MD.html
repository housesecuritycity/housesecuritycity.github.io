What we don't love is that it leaves gaps in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending upon the settings. We have seen some improvements because the camera's launch, and will continue to evaluate and update this evaluation, as needed.</p>
<p>IP security cameras capture analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection. The recorded digital video stream is then relayed over a local location network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which captures each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be established to interact by means of network or mobile app for seeing.</p>

In most cases, you'll have the ability to install cameras and electrical wiring merely by running the wires through a drop tile ceiling and into the wall.

Likewise, it will arm itself automatically when everyone has left.</p>
