<p>One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 per month, which might be a budget-friendly alternative for consumers in backwoods.

<p>With an analog system, coax cable is needed for transferring video footage from the CCTV security cameras. This is among the disadvantages of analog CCTV video surveillance, as the cable can be expensive and challenging to install, especially for larger camera networks, and those were cameras must be placed in tough areas. When consumers buy among ADT's security packages, the company sends an authorized professional with approximately 11 years experience to evaluate the home and install the equipment. In many cases, the company is able to supply professional installation services the same day.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in multiple areas around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) along with an Android smartphone (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint provides a wide range of equipment and home automation products at an affordable rate, the one area where the company particularly excels is in DIY installation. </p>
