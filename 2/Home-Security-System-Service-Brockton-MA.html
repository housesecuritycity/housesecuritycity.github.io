This chapter governs burglar alarm systems planned to summon cops department personnel, needs registration, evaluation of costs for excessive incorrect burglar alarms, offers treatments for repeat culprits, and offers an efficient date. Another huge function is night vision. You might also think about a camera with a built-in motion-activated light-- all the better to frighten you with, my dear!

<p>Some property owners post decoy alarm indications hoping they'll prevent possible burglars.
