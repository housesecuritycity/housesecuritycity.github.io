We initially discovered Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it quickly ended up being a staff (and family and friends) fave. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker.
