<p>Despite having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its minimal, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug.

Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we don't suggest it since its battery-saving regimens can disrupt performance.</p>
