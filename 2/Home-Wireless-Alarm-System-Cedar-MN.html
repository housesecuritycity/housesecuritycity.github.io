<p>The biggest disadvantage of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensing unit gets triggered while you're away, you have no visual methods of confirming if something is actually incorrect and how serious the scenario is. If the alarm incident is figured out to be an incorrect alarm, the city will send by mail a billing summarizing the occurrence and examining a fee, if any.</p>

<p>Carbon monoxide gas detection. Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a gas that can be toxic to both animals and human beings.

It turned out to be an incorrect alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
