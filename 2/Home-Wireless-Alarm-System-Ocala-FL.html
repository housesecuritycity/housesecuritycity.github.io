<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
