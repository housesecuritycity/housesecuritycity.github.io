<p>Designs: There are a number of different types of security cameras out there. Some of the more common ones are bullet cameras, which are the rectangle-shaped boxes you may see extending from a wall; dome cameras, which are often connected to a ceiling and housed in a tinted cover; and pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras, which offer remote-control abilities to change the field of vision. Depending on your specific security needs, you'll want to consider which types of cameras to use in equipping your system.</p>
<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly fee for a set amount of time, usually one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of dedicating to a long-term plan, are becoming more typical. These systems in some cases cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that offer a discount in exchange for that prolonged service arrangement. Spending for the equipment up front provides you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can stop the monitoring and start service as sometimes as you desire.</p>

This newer version is much the same, to be frank.</p>
