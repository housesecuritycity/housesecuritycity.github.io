<p>When installing cameras inside your house isn't a choice, you might want to explore hidden cameras, which are cameras that are small and discreet, in some cases fitted into everyday objects such as clocks, smoke alarm, and magnets. If you need to record an essential meeting in a public location, an individual hidden camera developed into a watch or pen might be a good option. Lastly, if you just wish to see what your employees are up to when you aren't nearby, a hidden camera connected to a CCTV camera system may be the very best choice.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
<p>Criminal offense, Cost and Advantages: Public surveillance camera systems can be a cost-efficient way to deter, file, and lower criminal activities.
