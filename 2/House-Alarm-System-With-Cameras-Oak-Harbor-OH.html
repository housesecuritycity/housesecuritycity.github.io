<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular since the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
