<p>Absolutely nothing is more important than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. You don't have to invest in a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your property and belongings. In case your alarm is set off, your home security system sends a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security professionals are standing by to react by immediately getting in touch with you and if need be, the regional medical, fire or cops authorities.</p>
<p>Your security system will be monitored by our operators at our own UL Listed main monitoring station.
