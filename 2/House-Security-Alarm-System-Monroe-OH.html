<p>Condo associations may prohibit homeowners from drilling holes in outside walls. Locals of these residences may be better off utilizing a wireless security system. Wireless alarms are also ideal for renters, as they can take the system with them when they move. Homeowners, on the other hand, have a much higher degree of choice. They can choose wired or wireless systems without much hassle.</p>
