When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching.

<p>Nevermind how excellent the cameras are. The very first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your data to 3rd party companies? I have actually ditched my Nest Cams since they were purchased by Google. Something all of us need to think of. Sirens. So your camera has discovered burglars or wild animals. Do you wish to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will work. Note that these sirens may violate local noise control laws, so inspect ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically innovative outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which instantly zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view.

It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even identify people you've labeled (after a learning period). But like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
