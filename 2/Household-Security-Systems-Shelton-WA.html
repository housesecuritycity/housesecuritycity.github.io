<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those individuals and will send out smart device informs with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
