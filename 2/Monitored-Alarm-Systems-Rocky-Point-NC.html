<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly typical. If a house owner forgets their secrets and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by a neighborhood cat, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. False alarms take place.
