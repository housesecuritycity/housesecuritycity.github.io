<p>Do burglar alarms account for robbery declines in the United States?

<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
