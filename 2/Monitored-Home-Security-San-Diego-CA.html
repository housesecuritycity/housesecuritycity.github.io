<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically more secure, but after reading this article, it will sure make you feel practically vulnerable. The other notable features of the Pro 2 are that unlike the Q Plus (the other Arlo design which I'm going to go over in just a 2nd), it is developed for outdoor as well as indoor use, so it'll work come rain or shine. It also has a USB slot so you can tape-record your footage straight onto there, which conserves you needing to handle the cloud storage system discussed above.</p>
<p>The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our screening, however, we found the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with horrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our unit was faulty, therefore we may revisit this review.</p>
