<p>The price of admission for the Deep Sentinel Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, due to the fact that it consists of 3 outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month membership cost sounds expensive, however it's not so much when you think about that a live human is seeing a live feed whenever the cameras discover suspicious activity. That person at Deep Sentinel's center can alert a suspicious individual that they're being observed, and they can call your local cops dispatcher if they refuse to leave or engage in a criminal act.
