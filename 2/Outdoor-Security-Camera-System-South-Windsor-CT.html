<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
