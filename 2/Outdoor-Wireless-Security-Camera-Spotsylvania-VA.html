<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single interface, an in-depth knowledge of all the required systems is necessary. If there are no as-built documents providing performance and configuration info to make this combination work, there are just two choices. The first choice, which may be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial service provider is unwilling or unavailable to supply those details) and record the geography and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other method is to change and rip, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
