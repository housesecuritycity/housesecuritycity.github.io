<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>In addition, IP cameras are compatible with network video recorders (NVRs), which offer a number of other benefits over the older digital video recorders (DVRs) that this guide will cover.
