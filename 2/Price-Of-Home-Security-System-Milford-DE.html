Commercial homes tend to have even higher false alarm rates than houses since more people tend to share responsibility for triggering and shutting off the alarm systems, and the systems tend to be more complex. The rate of incorrect alarms for commercial alarm users might be as much as 3 times greater than the rate of incorrect alarms amongst residential alarm users. 9 Chronic incorrect alarm activations are often due to insufficient worker training or inferior systems that have actually not been upgraded.</p>
<p>Some homeowners post decoy alarm indications hoping they'll discourage potential robbers. These indications might be attached to a front door, a prominent window, posted in the front lawn, or at the top of a driveway.
