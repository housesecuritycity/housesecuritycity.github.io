<p>The cost of admission for the Deep Sentinel Home Security system isn't that high, even at $499, since it consists of 3 outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds expensive, however it's not a lot when you consider that a live human being is viewing a live feed whenever the cameras discover suspicious activity. That person at Deep Sentinel's center can alert a suspicious individual that they're being observed, and they can call your local cops dispatcher if they decline to leave or engage in a criminal act. It's not for everyone, but it's the best DIY outdoor security camera we've seen to date.</p>
