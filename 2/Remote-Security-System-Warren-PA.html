<p>As the name suggests, this alarm system is a starter kit". So it's pretty much expected that it won't have actually extended customizability or a vast array of functions.

Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. When it comes to surveillance cameras, there are some tricky repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
<p>False Alarms - Permitted 3 (free) in a 12-month duration. They don't work. In New York a man got stabbed and was left to die in front of 3 surveillance cameras.
