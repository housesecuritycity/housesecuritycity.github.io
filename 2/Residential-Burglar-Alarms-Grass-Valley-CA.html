Because it utilizes infrared sensing units and mass detection to separate between individuals and other inanimate items or smaller sized living things, it just gets activated when a human comes in close proximity. If your motion sensing unit is activated, you get a notice in your smartphone app. There's no latency so you get alerted instantly so you can take immediate actions such as triggering a loud alarm, contacting the authorities, or using the camera's two-way audio system to speak to the prospective trespassers.</p>

Purchase good door locks and window locks, and make certain crucial areas like entryways and the sales register are well-lit.</p>
