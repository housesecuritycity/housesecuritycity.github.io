Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to discover any physical attempt to permeate the barrier.

<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and often over long distances.

In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the need for additional wiring.
