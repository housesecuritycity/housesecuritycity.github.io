Once a zone has actually been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. As soon as the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped.

Furthermore, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the danger and, if needed, could simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
