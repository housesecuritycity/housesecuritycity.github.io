<h3>Home Security Camera Reviews in West Virginia</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never matches the manufacturer's stats considering that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the most significant offender for brief battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capability is a bit minimal to recommend as a top pick.</p>
<p>Throughout our testing, this compact camera tape-recorded sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom was useful for taking a better look. We particularly like this camera's large, 180-degree field of view, due to the fact that you're less likely to get a blind spot anywhere you set it up. For less than $400, you get two door and window sensing units, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>
