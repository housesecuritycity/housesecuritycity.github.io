We selected 2 local home alarm companies in Seattle to compare to the national companies: Protective Systems Inc., and Absolute Security Alarms.

<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are nearly similar to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are a little more pricey for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation charges are onerous, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyhow.</p>
