We also like that the Kasa Web cam Outdoor won't spend a lot (it costs $88.16 at the time of writing), and it's super simple to install. Buying multiple Arlo Pro 2's can get pricey. (A four-camera pack costs $504.72 at the time of composing.) But we can't fault Arlo too much for that-- any high-quality multi-camera system is going to strike your wallet hard.</p>

If your system equipment consists of an audible alarm, the sound may frighten prospective burglars-- if you're lucky. But the police will not come until you personally call them. </p>
