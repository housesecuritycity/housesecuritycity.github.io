<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall.

Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to overlook things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
