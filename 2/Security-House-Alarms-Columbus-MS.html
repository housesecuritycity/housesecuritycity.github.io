<p>Think about it in this manner, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more sophisticated camera be sold for the low price of forty dollars?

We also found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
