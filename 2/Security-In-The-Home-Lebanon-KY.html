Arlo has just introduced the $129 Essential Spotlight Camera, a wireless outdoor Wi-Fi camera which has an integrated in spotlight, 1080p camera, and two-way audio. Its most direct competitor is the Ring Spotlight Cam Battery, which costs $199. You can preorder the Necessary Spotlight Camera on Arlo's website, and it's anticipated to deliver July 13.</p>

<p>Basically, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of video footage to the cloud.

<p>In the end, for the majority of customers, making the best option will boil down to the company's customer support track record and your specific equipment requirements.

Monitored home security systems can provide unrivaled comfort for a relatively small month-to-month charge. It's a rewarding financial investment in your home and individual safety.</p>
<p>You can pick from SimpliSafe's original award-winning system or their latest line of equipment. Both systems provide exceptional, reliable home security.
