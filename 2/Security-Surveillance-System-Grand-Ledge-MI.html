<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our testing-- during the day and at night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We should note that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based on readily available bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day. Nest consists of the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that may beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
