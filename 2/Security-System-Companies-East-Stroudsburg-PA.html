Well, you begin here with our expert insight on exactly what to consider when searching for a home security system.</p>
<p>To understand how home wireless security systems work, some basic understanding of alarm systems is useful. Although there are a range of additional system components available consisting of smoke alarm and wireless security cameras, the basic alarm includes 3 primary components: a keypad control panel, specific sensors, and a manned monitoring station.</p>
<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false sense of security given that it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>

<p>In addition to the system itself, security alarms are often combined with a monitoring service. In the event of an alarm, the facilities control system contacts a main monitoring station. Operators at the station see the signal and take proper action, such as contacting homeowner, notifying cops, or dispatching personal security forces. Such signals may be transferred by means of devoted alarm circuits, telephone lines, or the web.</p>
<p>The downside? It's very simple to devote security mistakes that will leave your home vulnerable. The minute you drive out of signal range or turn your phone to airplane mode is the moment you have actually left your house open.

Still, the unmonitored system is much less expensive and for that reason is still the much better option for many who are only concerned about cost. </p>
