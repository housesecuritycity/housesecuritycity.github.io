We like that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get costly. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it just keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.
