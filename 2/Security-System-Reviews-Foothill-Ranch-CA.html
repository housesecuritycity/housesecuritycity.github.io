<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false sense of security since it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
