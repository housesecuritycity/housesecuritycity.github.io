<p>When choosing between home security companies, who you pick matters.

The TP-Link Kasa Cam Outdoor is a versatile little camera that works well as a one-off design. There's your explanation as to why Nest's camera costs ₤ 80 more.

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine individuals the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send out smart device informs with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
