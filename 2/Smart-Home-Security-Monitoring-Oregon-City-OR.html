<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal considering that the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers recognize that the economical customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
