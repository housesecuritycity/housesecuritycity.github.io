<p>The huge benefit is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a gadget that doesn't look like a home security system. You can set the alarm off or contact emergency situation services direct from the app if you see a disruption, and it hardly ever sends incorrect notifies because it tracks your phone (and other family member's phones), so understands when you're at home and turns everything off. Likewise, it will arm itself automatically when everyone has left.</p>
<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect complacency since it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
