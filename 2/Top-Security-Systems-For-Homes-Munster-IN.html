<p>Because it's more complex than it should be, we don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, notifies, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for one month.
