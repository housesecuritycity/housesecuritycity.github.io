So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device alerts and live views were painfully slow, and the range is poor. Also, if the camera is in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video in dark conditions.
