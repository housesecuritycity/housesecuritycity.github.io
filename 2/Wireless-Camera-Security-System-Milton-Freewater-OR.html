<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize individuals the camera is finding using face acknowledgment.

We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
