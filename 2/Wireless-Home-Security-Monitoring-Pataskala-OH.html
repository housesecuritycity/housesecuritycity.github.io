<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
<p>Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they tape-record; everything within their focus ability is caught. That is to say, CCTV cameras are pretty un-focused when it comes to separating the images of an active event about to happen.
