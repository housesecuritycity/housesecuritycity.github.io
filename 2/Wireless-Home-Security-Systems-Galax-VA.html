<p>To assess reaction times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of 5 times, using contact and motion sensing units. However, remember that the monitoring company's response time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls need to be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

<p>If you do experience a home invasion emergency situation, you can set off the 80dB alarm. I am slightly disappointed by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas many other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. In spite of that, the alarm ought to be enough to frighten trespassers most of the times. To hold and recoup costs alarm companies responsible for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company should be licensed, pay any registration or false alarm costs, and offer physical evidence like camera video or a broken window to require police reaction.</p>

<p>Frontpoint uses 5 packages and 2 monitoring plans: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester opted for the Interactive plan however wound up dissatisfied with its absence of live video surveillance. When she got an alarm notification while on trip, she had no way of determining whether her home had actually been gotten into or if her cat had handled to trip the sensor. It turned out to be a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
<h3>Home Security Alarm Monitoring in Virginia</h3>
<p>Frontpoint provides excellent customer service and the very best Do It Yourself installation experience.

Although the do-it-yourself solution is available, it is an inferior security solution that is not as reputable as a local expert alarm company.</p>
