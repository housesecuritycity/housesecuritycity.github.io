<p>One of the very best aspects of this alarm is that it has a very sophisticated motion sensing unit.

As soon as the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and switching off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
