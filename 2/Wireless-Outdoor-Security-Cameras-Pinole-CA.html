<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false sense of security since it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
