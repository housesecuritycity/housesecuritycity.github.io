<p>I have this camera attached to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able place the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without difficulty. The IR lights during the night have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the price and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>

<p>The Canary Flex features a smart variation that sends out signals directly to your phone if you're looking for motion detection. This camera uses a variety of functions consisting of a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I examined a Swann camera I explained it as distinctly middle of the roadway.
