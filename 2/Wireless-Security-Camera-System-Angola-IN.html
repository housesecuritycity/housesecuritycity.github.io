<p>I have this camera attached to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able place the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my corridor.

<p>The Canary Flex features a smart variation that sends out signals directly to your phone if you're looking for motion detection. This camera uses a variety of functions consisting of a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I examined a Swann camera I explained it as distinctly middle of the roadway.
