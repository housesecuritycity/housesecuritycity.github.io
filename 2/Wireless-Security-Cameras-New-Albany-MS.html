<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal because the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
