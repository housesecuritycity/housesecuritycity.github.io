You just plug it in and you're up and running.

<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our testing-- during the day and during the night-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We need to note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based upon available bandwidth, which might change throughout the day. Nest includes the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that may defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
