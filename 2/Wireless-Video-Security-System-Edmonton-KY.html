<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
