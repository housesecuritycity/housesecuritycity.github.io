<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed looks and face acknowledgment software. The latter allows you to see exactly when a particular individual gets to the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time.
