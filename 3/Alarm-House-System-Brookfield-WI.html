<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially noticed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it rapidly became a staff (and family and friends) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker.
