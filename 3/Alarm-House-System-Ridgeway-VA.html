<p>Research studies show surveillance cameras reduce criminal offense. Wired: Each camera is connected to a recording system, which in turn is linked to a router. Installation can be intricate - especially if your home has already been built - so make sure to talk to a professional prior to taking on the task yourself. Wired home security cameras send information through a closed circuit, not over a signal. They're also not vulnerable to interference such as cellular and radio frequencies.
