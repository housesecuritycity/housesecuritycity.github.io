<h3>Home Alarm Monitoring in Bridgeton MO</h3>

There's no hard disk or camera included, so you'll require to acquire those separately. It records approximately 1,920 x 1,080 resolution output with clear colours and as crisp image as you'll get at Full HD.

<p>There's no dedicated hub involved here - each camera connects directly to your router through Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there.
