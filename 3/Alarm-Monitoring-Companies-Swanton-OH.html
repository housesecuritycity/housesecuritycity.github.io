<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the very same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually set up on the patio by a licensed electrician (who occurs to be my other half). All of the cameras were connected to the very same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router indoors (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>We attempted each of the cameras in multiple areas around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera utilizing an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) along with an Android mobile phone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie).
