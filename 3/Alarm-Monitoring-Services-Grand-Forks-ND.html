<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.

When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to recognize those individuals and will send out smartphone alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
