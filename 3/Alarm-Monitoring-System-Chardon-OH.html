<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular since the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
