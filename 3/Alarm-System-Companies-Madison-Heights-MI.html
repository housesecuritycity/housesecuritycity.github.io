<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to spot it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false sense of security given that it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
