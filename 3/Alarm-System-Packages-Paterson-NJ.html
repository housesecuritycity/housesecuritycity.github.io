<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. In a network injection attack, a hacker can make use of gain access to points that are exposed to non-filtered network traffic, specifically broadcasting network traffic such as Covering Tree" (802.1 D), OSPF, RIP, and HSRP The hacker injects fake networking re-configuration commands that affect routers, switches, and intelligent hubs. A whole network can be lowered in this manner and need rebooting or perhaps reprogramming of all smart networking devices.</p>
