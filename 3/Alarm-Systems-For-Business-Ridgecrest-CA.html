<p>There are 2 outdoor security camera designs - dome or bullet-shaped.

<p>An NVR makes it easy to tape video surveillance footage, however you will require linked hard disk drives on which to save this footage. Choosing the correct amount of storage can seem like a confusing gamble, but it does not have to be; it's just a matter of determining the length of video you need to store, by the bitrate and resolution your camera shoots at.
