<p>As the name suggests, this alarm system is a starter kit". So it's practically expected that it won't have extended customizability or a wide variety of functions.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.
