<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Possession protection devices are developed to protect particular, tangible properties, such as precious jewelry, paintings, money boxes, and family treasures. These gadgets can be outfitted with anti-tampering technology to prevent being deactivated. The sensing unit will activate an alarm if the product to which the device has actually been connected is moved or interrupted.</p>
<p>Some property owners post decoy alarm indications hoping they'll hinder prospective intruders. These signs may be attached to a front door, a prominent window, posted in the front yard, or at the top of a driveway. The concept of publishing a security alarm indication is that prospective scoundrels might not want to take a gamble about whether the sign suggests the existence of a home security system.</p>
