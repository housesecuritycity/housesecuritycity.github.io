<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it should be. Recordings, notifies, and integration all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we typically discovered action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
