<p>Nevermind how excellent the cameras are. The very first question you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to 3rd party companies? I have actually dumped my Nest Cams given that they were bought by Google. Something we all require to consider. Sirens. So your camera has actually found trespassers or wild animals. Do you want to terrify them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will suffice. Note that these sirens might break local sound control laws, so examine ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. If catching footage in the dark is a priority, make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they tape-record; everything within their focus ability is caught. That is to say, CCTV cameras are quite un-focused when it pertains to isolating the images of an active event about to happen. But you can't buy this camera by itself-- you need to contribute to a complete Vivint home security system. </p>
