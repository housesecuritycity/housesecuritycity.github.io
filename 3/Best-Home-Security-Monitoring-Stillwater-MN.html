<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a destructive aggressor, considering that the disruption of the network avoids the flow of information and really indirectly safeguards data by preventing it from being transferred. The typical reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying an opportunity for the destructive assaulter to record these codes and use different breaking tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools offered which can release a dictionary design attack of "potentially accepted" security secrets based upon the "model" security key captured throughout the network healing.</p>
