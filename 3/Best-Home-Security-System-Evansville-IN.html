<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are nearly identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are a little more expensive for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation fees are burdensome, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyhow.</p>
