<p>A taut wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to overlook objects that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
