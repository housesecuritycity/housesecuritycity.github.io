<p>This system utilizes an electro-magnetic field disturbance principle based upon two unshielded (or 'leaking') coax cables buried around 30 cm (1 ft) deep and 1 m (10 feet) apart. 6 The transmitter produces continuous Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable television and the energy is gotten by the other cable. When the change in field strength compromises due to the presence of a things and reaches a pre-set lower threshold, an alarm condition is generated. The system is hidden after installation. Care should be required to ensure the surrounding soil provides good drainage in order to prevent annoyance alarms.</p>
<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month fee for a set amount of time, generally one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than dedicating to a long-lasting arrangement, are ending up being more typical. These systems in some cases cost more up front for the hardware than professional systems that provide a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service agreement. Paying for the equipment in advance provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can start and stop the monitoring service as often times as you desire.</p>
