<p>Throughout the spring and summertime, home security or alarm companies work with traveling sales representatives to go door-to-door, making unsolicited "cold calls" on homeowners. Sometimes, the salespeople use high-pressure or misleading sales strategies to get possible customers to buy expensive, and sometimes substandard, systems or equipment they don't require.</p>
<p>So why do not we rank ADT higher? In some ways, ADT annoys us. We see a lot of growing companies branching off and attempting new things in the home security area. But ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its rates isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to discuss that the customer support experience varies commonly depending upon the dealership you go with. </p>
