I called their client service group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to mention it, it's on you to check out the fine print.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
<p>The drawback? It's very simple to devote security mistakes that will leave your home susceptible. The minute you drive out of signal range or turn your phone to plane mode is the moment you've left your house open.

Nevertheless, with an unmonitored system, it depends on you to call the cops or other emergency situation services if your home remains in threat. Still, the unmonitored system is much less expensive and for that reason is still the better option for many who are only concerned about cost. </p>
