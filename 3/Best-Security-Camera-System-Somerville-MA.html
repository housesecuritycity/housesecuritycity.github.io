If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we do not believe that these problems change the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our existing suggestion.</p>
