The photo is sharp and clear and I saw extremely little lag between my actions and the image displayed on the app. I 'd definitely say it's one of the better cameras in terms of video quality.</p>
<p>Another advantage to monitored systems is if you acquire a monitored security strategy, the exact same company that keeps an eye on the system will install it for you. If you're not mechanically inclined, having a professional set up the system might give you more confidence than if you did the work yourself. Wireless cameras can't have everything-- see things inside by day, and watch on what's going on outside after dark. It hardly ever works.</p>
<p>Outdoor security cameras are typically more expensive than their indoor counterparts. They can range in rate from around $100 approximately $400 depending upon functions.
