<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>

Hardwired systems require very little maintenance, and short of a general power failure, are more difficult to interrupt. Despite a basic enhancement in wireless innovation, there appear to be less methods for hardwired systems to be interfered with and crippled. </p>
