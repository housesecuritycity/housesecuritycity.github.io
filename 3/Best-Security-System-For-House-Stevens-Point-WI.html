The clever bit is that the camera not only finds that individuals have entered its 130-degree field of view, but it will also have a stab at recognising them too. Maybe more usefully, if someone passes who the camera doesn't understand, you get an alert about an "unidentified face". You can inform the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it should automatically understand.</p>

<h3>Top Security Systems For Homes in Stevens Point WI</h3>
<p>Some people would rather pay an alarm company the month-to-month monitoring rate rather of buying a self-monitored security system.
