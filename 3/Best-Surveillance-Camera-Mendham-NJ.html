<p>Cameras typically broadcast video footage over the Internet, allowing operators to monitor security camera feeds remotely. In some cases, surveillance systems are spent for and operated by the cities themselves. But in other cases, companies and homeowners share surveillance camera video footage with policeman. Just like any security system, the more equipment you include, the more expensive it gets. Which rate leaps a lot when you include smart cameras to any Blue system. We like that you can pick from indoor, outdoor, and doorbell cameras, but every smart camera Blue offers is $200.</p>
