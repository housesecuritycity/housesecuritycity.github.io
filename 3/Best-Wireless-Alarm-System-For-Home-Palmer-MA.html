<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can identify people the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those people and will send smartphone signals with that info when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random strangers.
