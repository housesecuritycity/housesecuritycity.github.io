<p>If I liked the look of the Nest, then I enjoy the Hive View's design - certainly the most aesthetically pleasing camera on this list.

<p>The Nest Web Cam Indoor is the 3rd generation of the popular Dropcam-- among the first, and among the very best home security cameras-- and bumps up its predecessors' video quality to 1080p. It's simple to set up and, thanks to its magnetic, rotating base, it can be set up almost anywhere inside. The video looks sharp; night vision is clear; the camera can be used as an intercom; and it communicates with the Nest Thermostat and the Nest Protect smoke detector, as well as numerous third-party wise- home gadgets. However to truly use the camera's features, you'll need to shell out $10 or more per month for the Nest Aware program, which offers you access to cloud storage, individual detection and customizable activity zones.</p>
<p>A self-monitored system must be wise. It should have the ability to follow guidelines with cause-and-effect relationships in between various gadgets.

Or you can produce another rule that states if the front door is open, your security camera must automatically start tape-recording footage.

<p>The greatest, baddest feature is the Arlo Ultra's 4K video streaming with HDR, which provides you extremely crisp, clear footage that lets you zoom in on information like faces and license plates without screwing up your image quality. The Nest Labs Nest Cam provides higher-than-typical 1080p video resolution. Ramping up into security services fits with this, too.
