<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to discover any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to neglect things that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>

Incorrect alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they take place often enough. Another possible downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is normally balanced out by the fact that there are no installation costs.</p>
