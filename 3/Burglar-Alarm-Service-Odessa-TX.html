<p>A tight wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to find any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to ignore items that exert percentages of pressure on the wires.
