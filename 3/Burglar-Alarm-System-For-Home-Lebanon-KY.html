<p>Absolutely nothing is more vital than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your family and home. The implicit validation for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the danger of terrorist attacks. But suicide assaulters are clearly not prevented by camera - and might even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can make sure - and the expenditure of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up roughly 20 percent of that country's criminal justice spending plan - far surpasses the limited benefits that the system may provide in examining attacks or tried attacks after the reality (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

<p>If you can't recognize who or what the camera is looking at, there's no usage in having an outdoor security camera.
