<p>While every house owner stresses over burglaries, uncertainty has surrounded home security systems due to their generally high expenses, complicated contracts with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces typically leading to false alarms. A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system linked together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, offering trusted video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years earlier, we invented security and alarm monitoring services.

<p>Whether you decide to go with a Do It Yourself system or opt for an expertly installed system, you'll need to pay a yearly or month-to-month charge if you need monitoring, and sometimes, you'll be struck with a regular monthly fee to pay off the cost of hardware components.
