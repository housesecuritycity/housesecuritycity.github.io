<p>While every house owner stresses over burglaries, uncertainty has surrounded home security systems due to their generally high expenses, complicated contracts with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces typically leading to false alarms. A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system linked together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, offering trusted video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years earlier, we invented security and alarm monitoring services. Today, we're reinventing the smart home. Firsts like Blue are what we do.

<p>Whether you decide to go with a Do It Yourself system or opt for an expertly installed system, you'll need to pay a yearly or month-to-month charge if you need monitoring, and sometimes, you'll be struck with a regular monthly fee to pay off the cost of hardware components.
