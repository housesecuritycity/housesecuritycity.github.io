<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
