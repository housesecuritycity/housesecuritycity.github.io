<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
