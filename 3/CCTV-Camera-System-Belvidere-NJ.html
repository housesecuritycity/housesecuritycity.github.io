<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the patio by a certified electrical expert (who happens to be my partner). All of the cameras were connected to the very same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router inside your home (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those individuals and will send out smartphone alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
