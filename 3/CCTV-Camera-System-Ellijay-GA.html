<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed appearances and face recognition software. The latter allows you to see precisely when a particular individual gets to your house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. However Netatmo has actually expanded its security range with a fantastic outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof doors and window sensors called Tags (₤ 89.99).

<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify individuals the camera is finding using face acknowledgment.

We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
