<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically much safer, but after reading this post, it will sure make you feel practically vulnerable. A few minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control panel up and online-- it just would not connect.

Certainly not perfect-- but the rep apologized and shipped her replacement control panel over night.</p>
