As our officers respond to reports of criminal activity in our neighborhood, they might have the ability to utilize the information or video footage recorded on these security cameras to assist in the apprehension and prosecution of the bad guys involved.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
<p>We also enjoy that Ring still has decent clever home assistance. Some other cheap security systems, like SimpliSafe and Cove, don't work so well with clever home gadgets like locks and lights. Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can incorporate your clever outlets with your overall security system. Wireless keypads and keychains so you can manage your alarm system from anywhere inside or near your business. </p>
