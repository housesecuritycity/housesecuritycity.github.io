This program is meant to assist hinder criminal activity and assist police with investigations.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video in the dark is a concern.</p>
<p>So what happens if something triggers your alarm but you're in a meeting with a supplier and you don't get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed vacation and your spotty cell service means you don't get notified up until the next day? If your system equipment includes an audible alarm, the sound may frighten potential trespassers-- if you're lucky. However the police will not come until you personally call them. </p>
