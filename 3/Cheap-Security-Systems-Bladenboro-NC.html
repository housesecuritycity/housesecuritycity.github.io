<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically more secure, but after reading this article, it will sure make you feel virtually vulnerable. A few minutes into the Do It Yourself installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it just would not connect. An aid window popped up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint associate helped her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he could tell there was an issue with the circuit board. Definitely not perfect-- but the rep said sorry and shipped her replacement control board overnight.</p>
<p>After testing lots of wired and wireless alternatives, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2.

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have a contract, and its equipment pricing is very reasonable, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>
