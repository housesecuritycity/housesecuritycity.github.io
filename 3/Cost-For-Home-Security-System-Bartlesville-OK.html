We likewise like that the Kasa Webcam Outdoor will not spend a lot (it costs $88.16 at the time of writing), and it's super simple to install. Purchasing several Arlo Pro 2's can get expensive. (A four-camera pack costs $504.72 at the time of writing.) But we can't fault Arlo too much for that-- any premium multi-camera system is going to hit your wallet hard.</p>
