<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal because the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
