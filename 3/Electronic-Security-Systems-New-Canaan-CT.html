<p>This system utilizes an electro-magnetic field disturbance principle based on two unshielded (or 'dripping') coaxial cables buried roughly 30 cm (1 feet) deep and 1 m (10 ft) apart. 6 The transmitter gives off constant Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable television and the energy is gotten by the other cable television. When the change in field strength compromises due to the presence of an object and reaches a pre-set lower limit, an alarm condition is created. The system is hidden after installation. Care must be required to ensure the surrounding soil provides good drain in order to avoid annoyance alarms.</p>

<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically innovative outdoor camera we have actually checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of vision.

It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even recognize people you have actually identified (after a knowing duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
