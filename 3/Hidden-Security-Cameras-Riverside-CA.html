<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are practically identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are slightly more costly for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation costs are onerous, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyway.</p>
<p>Wired systems offer permanence and greater reliability, while wireless systems offer a high level of customization and the ease of mobility. While the equipment for wired security systems is usually less expensive, installation costs can take a bigger toll on your wallet than wireless security would. Regardless of which option you choose, you can rest assured that both kinds of security systems are making your home a much safer location for your household and supplying you with higher comfort.</p>
