As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once clients recognize that the economical customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
