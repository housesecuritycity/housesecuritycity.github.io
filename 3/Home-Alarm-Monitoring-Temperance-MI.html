<p>Yes. There are self-monitored systems that admit to a home's security app to as much as 20 family members. Nevertheless, shared monitoring isn't a function offered from all companies.

Responding to incorrect alarms can unnecessarily cost Sumner - and its taxpayers - cash each year. In addition, officers responding to these incorrect alarms are unable to respond to actual emergency situations or conduct preventative patrols.</p>
