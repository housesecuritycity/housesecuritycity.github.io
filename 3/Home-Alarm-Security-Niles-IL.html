<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are 3 times most likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and runs its own US-based monitoring center. Its monitoring service consists of a benefit called ASAPer, which concurrently messages a group of pre-set contacts to determine whether alarm activity is a true emergency situation or false alarm. Most monitoring center call household members one at a time, which can slow reaction times.</p>

However it is essential that you understand the basic rundown of the market leaders. We're talking brand names like SimpliSafe, Frontpoint, Vivint, ADT, Deep Guard, Abode Security, Ring Alarm, Protect America, Nest Secure, and last but not least, Brinks Home Security.

<p>Flood lights are often used in combination with motion detectors. When sensors detect motion, the lights light up the surrounding area, which will allow you to see who is on your home and will possibly frighten intruders.

Flood lights can deter vandals or scare them away, but as a single piece of equipment, they are more for your peace of mind than for home protection.</p>

<p>It depends on the size and layout of the home and the monitoring goals. The advantages of cameras are that you can get visual verification of any activity occurring inside or outside the home. If video becomes part of your monitoring package, it can be a big advantage in the event of a burglary because the monitoring company can report visual confirmation of the activity straight to the police to accelerate the dispatching of workers.</p>
