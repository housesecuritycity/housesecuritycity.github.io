<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
