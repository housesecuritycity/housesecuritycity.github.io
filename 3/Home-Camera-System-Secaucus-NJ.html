<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular since the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
