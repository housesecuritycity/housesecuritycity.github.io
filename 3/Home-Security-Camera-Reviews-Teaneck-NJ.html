Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

At Smith Thompson Security we believe the right thing to do is, is to show you the cost of the equipment and monitoring rate separately. That method you REALLY understand what you're spending. Even if you take advantage of our 12 months same as money funding alternative, when it's paid off, all you have actually left is our low monthly monitoring rate.</p>
