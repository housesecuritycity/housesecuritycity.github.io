In truth, we don't suggest purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to add the membership. Without it, you will not get the person-detection function, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity.
