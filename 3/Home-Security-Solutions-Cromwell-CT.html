<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had actually suffered an information breach, but we agree with its suggestion that users should reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a preventive procedure. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such occurrences. However, after this newest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have actually chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video items, we don't believe that these issues alter the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our present recommendation.</p>
