<p>We have actually all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". If you're trying to find a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality, this design from Samsung Wisenet will fit the expense. It ships with 4 smooth and white bullet-style cameras created for indoor and outdoor use. They're geared up with night vision tech that uses infrared LEDs and smart IR to offer up to130ft (or 40m) night vision variety. Like others on our list, the DVR system works with a mobile app that lets you see what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we found in our testing that the app occasionally forgot cameras which then needed to be re-added.</p>

Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not recommend it considering that its battery-saving routines can disrupt efficiency.</p>
