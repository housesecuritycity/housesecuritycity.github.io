As a former editor for Electronic House and Big Picture Big Sound, I've composed buying guides for multiple consumer-electronics items, and I have actually written posts covering innovation for The New York Times (which is now Wirecutter's parent company), Wired, Lady's Day, Male's Health, and other publications.</p>
<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect complacency since it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
