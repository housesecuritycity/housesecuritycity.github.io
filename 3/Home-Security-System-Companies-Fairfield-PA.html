<p>Camera compatibility: Not every video recorder can deal with every camera. Of course, DVRs require analog cameras, while NVRs utilize IP cameras, but the compatibility concern extends well beyond that difference. Some NVR systems, for instance, are compatible with the IP cameras only from particular makers and not others. When buying a video recorder, you must initially make certain that the device will deal with the cameras you have actually bought. If you're dealing with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system, the cameras ought to be able to provide you with the needed details.</p>
