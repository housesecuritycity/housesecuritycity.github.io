<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to integrate them together into a single user interface, an in-depth understanding of all the needed systems is essential. There are only two options if there are no as-built documents providing functionality and setup info to make this combination work. The very first alternative, which might be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original solution provider is unwilling or not available to supply those details) and document the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other approach is to rip and change, carrying out a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
<p>The possible worth of public surveillance innovation was well demonstrated all the method back in April, 2013 when investigators identified the two suspects in the Boston Marathon battle after sifting through video images recorded by the city's cameras.
