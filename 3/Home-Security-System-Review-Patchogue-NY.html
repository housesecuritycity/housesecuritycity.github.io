<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly typical. If a property owner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by a neighborhood cat, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. False alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the essential action.</p>
