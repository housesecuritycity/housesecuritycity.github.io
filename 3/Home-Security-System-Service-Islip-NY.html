<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, but not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for further circuitry. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls however will still need cables to power the security camera independently, typically by means of 110VAC power. </p>
