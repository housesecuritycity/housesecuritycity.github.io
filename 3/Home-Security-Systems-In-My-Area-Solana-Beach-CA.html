This model from Samsung Wisenet will fit the costs if you're looking for a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality. It ships with 4 white and streamlined bullet-style cameras developed for indoor and outdoor use.

Like others on our list, the DVR system works with a mobile app that lets you see what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we found in our testing that the app sometimes forgot cameras which then required to be re-added.</p>
