<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send out smart device alerts with that information when they appear at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
