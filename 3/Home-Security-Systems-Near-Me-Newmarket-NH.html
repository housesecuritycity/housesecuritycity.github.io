<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a quick description of how thermal cameras work: All objects release infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy given off by an object is known as its heat signature. In general, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it produces. A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that is capable of detecting small distinctions in temperature level. The gadget collects the infrared radiation from things in the scene and produces an electronic image based on information about the temperature level differences.

In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect sense of security because it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
