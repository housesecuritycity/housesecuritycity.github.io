<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. If capturing video in the dark is a concern, ensure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
