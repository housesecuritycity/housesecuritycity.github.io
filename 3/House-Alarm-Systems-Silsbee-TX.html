<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false complacency considering that it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
