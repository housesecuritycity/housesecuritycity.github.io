<p>If you do come across a home intrusion emergency situation, you can set off the 80dB alarm. I am slightly dissatisfied by the loudness of the alarm.

In spite of that, the alarm needs to be enough to scare away intruders for the most part. To hold and recoup costs alarm companies responsible for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company should be accredited, pay any registration or incorrect alarm fees, and offer physical evidence like camera footage or a damaged window to necessitate cops action.</p>
