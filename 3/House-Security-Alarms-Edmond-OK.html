<p>CCTV cameras are positioned in locations where they are believed to be most effective, which generally consists of extremely populated towns, town hall, car parks, or numerous other high-crime locations (Welsh and Farrington 2008). Considered that the positioning of these cameras is very essential, the criminal activity patterns in areas of interest are generally studied for amount of times to determine crime hotspots where cameras might possibly be put. In many cases, Geographic Information Systems technology is used to precisely assess criminal activity patterns for camera placement; however, the placement of cameras can also be the result of input from policeman and other criminal justice stakeholders (La Vigne et al. 2011).</p>
<p>I discussed that all we would require to do is take advantage of any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, which camera would end up being the user interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency button, it sends out dual signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the threat and, if required, could just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
