<p>SimpliSafe equipment covers the basics. However while ADT systems deal with Z-Wave gadgets, SimpliSafe systems do not. This seriously limits your alternatives for syncing a SimpliSafe system with third-party wise home devices like lights, locks, outlets, and thermostats. If you already have a security gadget from another brand, like a Blink XT camera, it probably won't deal with your SimpliSafe system.</p>
<p>For example, the bullet cameras with fixed lens are generally smaller than those with zoom lens. SimpliSafe has the most remarkable reaction time of all home security companies we examined. Their timeframe for action in under 10 seconds, which we should admit is rather remarkable.

However ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its rates isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to mention that the customer service experience differs widely depending upon the dealership you choose. </p>
