<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical since the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients recognize that the economical customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
