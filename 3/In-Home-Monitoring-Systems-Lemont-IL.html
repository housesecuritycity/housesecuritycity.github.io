<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus fraud, vandalism, and theft. You get 1080p HD streaming, a 130-degree field of vision, the usual motion notifies, and a 90+ dB alarm that is likely to scare off any approaching burglar before they have actually got too far into your home. When you're at home and do not want to be taped, the privacy-conscious will be pleased to hear there's a physical shutter you can close over the camera.</p>
<p>After evaluating lots of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be set up both inside and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is very affordable, so it's not a total splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>

With GO2 as your video surveillance camera installer, your business is provided valuable insights into your operations that would otherwise be unattainable.</p>
