The implicit justification for the current push to increase video surveillance is the threat of terrorist attacks.

<p>Among the challenges wise alarm pose to the customer is the risk of being hacked. Incorrect home network setups, defects in the devices or password compromise could enable a hacker to burglarize the system and figure out if anyone is home, or even seize control. Though storing the huge amount of data can be an issue, it's not unusual for IP CCTV systems to have software application that governs the length of time the video is saved, and at what quality. After a time, video can be compressed to conserve storage area, for instance.</p>
