We like that it likewise lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For the majority of homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get expensive. It's also worth keeping in mind that it needs to be installed on the ceiling (it only keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.
