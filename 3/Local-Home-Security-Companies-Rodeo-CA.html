<p>Seattle's main intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more responsible for incorrect alarms, and lower the variety of unneeded police and fire responses.

<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and frequently over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for further wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls however will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, generally through 110VAC power. </p>
