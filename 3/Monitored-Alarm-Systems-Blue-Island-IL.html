<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect complacency given that it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
