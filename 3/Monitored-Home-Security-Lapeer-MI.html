We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare individuals and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
