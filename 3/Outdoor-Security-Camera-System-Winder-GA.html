<p>We knew we had a job to do when SCW was established in 2010. Security cameras were never easy, and it was impossible to understand what you were getting or what to do with it. From the beginning, it has always been our function to provide the absolute best item for our customers' requirements, but that's inadequate.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>When I ultimately entered into the camera controls, I was reasonably impressed. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a strong night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly self-explanatory. You have actually got two-way audio, you can play melodies simply to let the person being seen know they're being enjoyed, and you can choose to record video or pictures and save them to your clever device on an impulse. </p>
