Porter for that reason noted that the Office and surveillance market need to ensure only hardware and software certified with relevant standards, such as Secure by Default, is installed in private and public spaces alike.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature.

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal because the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
