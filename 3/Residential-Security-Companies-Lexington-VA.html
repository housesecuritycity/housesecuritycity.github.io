<p>I discussed that all we would require to do is use any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, which camera would become the interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends out dual alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the threat and, if required, could simply push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
