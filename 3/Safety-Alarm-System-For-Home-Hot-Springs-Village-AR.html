<p>After testing, we sent out each of our top picks, in addition to the Wyze Cam v2, to Bill McKinley, head of information security at The New york city Times (Wirecutter's moms and dad company), for hack testing.

<p>We looked for Do It Yourself systems that offered expert monitoring, both with and without a contract.

<p>Nevertheless, wired systems aren't without their drawbacks. They tend to be more pricey to install, requiring the expertise of qualified professionals.
