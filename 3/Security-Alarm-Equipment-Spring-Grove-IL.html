<p>No. Monitored medical alarms are not included in this new law. These alarms differ from panic alarms, which are covered.

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send smartphone signals with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
