<p>Wireless systems, on the other hand, typically utilize battery-powered transmitters which are much easier to install and have cheaper start-up expenses, but might fail if the batteries are not preserved. Depending upon range and building products, several wireless repeaters might be required to bring the signal to the alarm panel reliably. A wireless system can be relocated to a new home quickly, a benefit for those who lease or who move regularly.
