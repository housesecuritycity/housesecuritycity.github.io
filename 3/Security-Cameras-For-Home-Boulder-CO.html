In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls must be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a personal guard. A number of cities also require a permit to even run a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are designed to restrict the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms.
