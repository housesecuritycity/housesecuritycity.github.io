We have actually found that battery life never matches the manufacturer's stats given that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant culprit for brief battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, however its recording capability is a bit limited to recommend as a top pick.</p>
<p>During our testing, this compact camera recorded sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom was useful for taking a better look. We specifically like this camera's broad, 180-degree field of view, because you're less most likely to get a blind area wherever you set it up. For less than $400, you get 2 door and window sensors, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>
