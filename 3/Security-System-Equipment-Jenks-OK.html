<p>Our alarm systems may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to recognize an offense. As soon as a zone has actually been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line.

Getting in the code on the alarm system's keypad and turning off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
