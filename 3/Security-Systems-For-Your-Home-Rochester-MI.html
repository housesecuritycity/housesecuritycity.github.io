<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for more wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera separately, typically by means of 110VAC power. </p>
