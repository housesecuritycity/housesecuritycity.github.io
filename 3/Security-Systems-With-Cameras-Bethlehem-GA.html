<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to recognize those individuals and will send out mobile phone notifies with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
