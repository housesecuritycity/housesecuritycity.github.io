<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are dependable, but not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for more circuitry. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera individually, generally via 110VAC power. </p>
