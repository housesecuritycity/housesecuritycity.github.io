<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send out smartphone informs with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
