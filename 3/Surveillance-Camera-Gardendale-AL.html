As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular because the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
