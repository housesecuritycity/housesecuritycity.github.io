<p>We didn't consider alarm systems that needed professional installation. Pro-installed systems usually cost more, use equipment similar to that of Do It Yourself systems, included generally onerous and long contracts, and often depend on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they offer little benefit.
