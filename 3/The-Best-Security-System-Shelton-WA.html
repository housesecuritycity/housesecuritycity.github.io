<h2>Smart Security Camera Systems And Video Surveillance Hardware Shelton</h2>
<p>I have this camera attached to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without problem. The IR lights during the night are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle.

Improper home network configurations, defects in the devices or password compromise might allow a hacker to burglarize the system and determine if anyone is home, or even take control.
