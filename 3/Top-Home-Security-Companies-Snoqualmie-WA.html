<h3>Home Security Alarm System in Washington</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never ever matches the maker's stats considering that this comes from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest culprit for brief battery life without a doubt. We agree with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capability is a bit restricted to recommend as a top pick.</p>
<p>During our testing, this compact camera tape-recorded sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom was useful for taking a more detailed look. We particularly like this camera's broad, 180-degree field of vision, because you're less most likely to get a blind area any place you set it up. For less than $400, you get 2 door and window sensing units, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>
