<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is premium, if not particularly cutting-edge, so we're actually suggesting the security cameras here.

Sure, you get a lower rate if you choose a three-year contract, but considering that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a big commitment.
