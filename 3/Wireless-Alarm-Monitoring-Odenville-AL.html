But I also value minimalist systems that parts that carry out more than one action, like Minut. Some parts can make home automation readily available to you. Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, wise lock, and so on), I want to ensure that they all quickly interact with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>
