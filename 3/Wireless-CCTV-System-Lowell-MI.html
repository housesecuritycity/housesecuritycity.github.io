<p>The 2nd important thing to say is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a remarkably shrill built-in alarm, so it operates as a home alarm in addition to a security camera.

I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out notifies, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

<p>So what takes place if something triggers your alarm however you remain in a conference with a supplier and you don't get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed vacation and your spotty cell service indicates you don't get informed up until the next day? The noise may terrify off would-be trespassers-- if you're lucky if your system equipment consists of an audible alarm. But the cops will not come up until you personally call them. </p>
