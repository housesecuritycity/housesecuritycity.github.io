<p>I discussed that all we would require to do is take advantage of any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, which camera would become the interface into the VMS system. When a client pushes the emergency button, it sends out double signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the danger and, if needed, could merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
