<p>Camera compatibility: Not every video recorder can work with every camera. Obviously, DVRs need analog cameras, while NVRs use IP cameras, but the compatibility concern extends well beyond that difference.

<p>Another consideration with wireless home security systems is the limited range of sensors. Most radio frequencies are weak outside a variety of 500 feet. This implies that you need to structure your wireless system with this in mind, especially if your home is larger than 4,500 square feet. When wanting to buy a surveillance camera, there are a couple of elements to think about.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally typical since the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
<p>When I ultimately got into the camera controls, I was fairly impressed. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a strong night-vision mode, and all the app controls are relatively self-explanatory. You've got two-way audio, you can play tunes simply to let the person being seen understand they're being seen, and you can pick to tape-record video or images and conserve them to your wise gadget on a whim. </p>
