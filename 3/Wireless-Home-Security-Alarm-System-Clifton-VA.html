<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically sophisticated outdoor camera we have actually checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and people, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even determine individuals you have actually identified (after a knowing period). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
