<p>Still, if technology has made us susceptible, then it can likewise make us secure. Tech companies have been pressing hard to innovate in the connected home CCTV camera area. Huge investments by the likes of Google-owned Nest, Amazon's Blink, and up-and-coming security company Ring have made home security cameras more popular.</p>
<p>Everything Vivint does, it succeeds. Where other alarm companies use a mishmash of third-party equipment, Vivint styles its own stuff. Where some alternatives, like ADT, have good equipment however so-so cameras, Vivint's cameras have some of the very best functions on the marketplace, including video analytics and 4K image sensing units (as well as more standard fare like motion detectors, two-way audio, and night vision).</p>
<p>There's a couple of other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving objects if it detects an intruder; a convenient intercom function that enables the device to function as a wise doorbell (although it doesn't have a chime or button - for that you'll require the Nest Hi doorbell ); and, because Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.</p>
<h3>House Security Alarm System in Oxford CT</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that Nest cameras aren't professionally monitored-- that part's on you. (The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However given that the majority of retail theft would not trip an alarm anyhow (a worker slipping some additional money while providing a consumer change, for example), we think it's more crucial to have top quality images so you have the evidence you require.

They offer flexibility in their equipment and available strategies, enabling house owners to choose the security solution that best suits their needs.
