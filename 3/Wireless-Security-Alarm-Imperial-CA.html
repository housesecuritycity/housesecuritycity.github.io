<p>Ring may not be the most innovative system on our list (Vivint takes that prize), however it sure has actually acquired rather the fanfare for many years. We've been checking Ring Alarm a fair bit recently, and we in fact like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security kit that offers basic intrusion protection with super-low month-to-month monitoring fees. Or ... no monitoring charges at all if you choose the totally free self-monitor" option.</p>
<p>However monitored systems likewise tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly charge for a set quantity of time, generally one to five years. No-contract systems, which enable you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than devoting to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more typical. These systems sometimes cost more in advance for the hardware than pro systems that use a discount in exchange for that lengthy service agreement.

<p>We liked Alder for their fast action times and total versatility. And controlling our system with their touchscreen panel was effortless and pretty darn streamlined. Otherwise, this company offers a comparable feature-set as brand names like Frontpoint and Brinks. With the quality of the equipment that is readily available today, it's safe to say that the wireless systems are simply as good, if not better, than the wired systems. Offered all of the other advantages, it's simple to see why a lot of people are choosing this alternative. </p>
