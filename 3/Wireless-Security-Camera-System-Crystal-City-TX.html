<p>A taut wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to discover any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to neglect items that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
