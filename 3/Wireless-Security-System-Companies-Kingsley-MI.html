Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days.

<p>Maybe this is no better showed than via Surveillance Camera Commissioner, Tony Porter's comments, at IFSEC International in 2019 Tony highlighted just how much had changed given that he took on the role in 2014, with the growth of facial recognition, drones, body-worn cameras, analytics, GDPR and much more. Modern systems now have phenomenal capabilities", though these have actually created reasonable misgivings about the danger for privacy and possible abuse such capabilities create. Porter for that reason kept in mind that the Home Office and surveillance industry need to ensure only software and hardware compliant with relevant standards, such as Secure by Default, is set up in private and public areas alike.</p>
<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video in the dark is a concern.</p>

In today's network-connected world, a surveillance system is rarely a stand-alone system. It is worth understanding if your proposed camera system will incorporate with other products. </p>
