<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
