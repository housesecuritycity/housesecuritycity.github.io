<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular since the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
